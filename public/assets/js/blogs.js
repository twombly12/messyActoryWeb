         <p>Below are some tools to help you get started. One important thing to remember is that the acting industry is a strange one, and your journey within it will be unlike anyone else’s – you will have to navigate it as you see fit – hopefully
                        these tips can help you on your way.</p>
               </p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="doTheWork">Be willing to do the work</h2>
                            <p>There is a reason this tip is first: The road ahead of you will not be easy, and it’s best to accept the challenge before taking any steps forward. A wise professor of mine told me, “If there is anything else you’d rather do –
                                Do it.”</p>
                            <p>Acting can come with fame and money but it can also come with many burdens, tons of rejection and a lot of hard work. Yes, there are actors who are “found” in a coffee shop. And Yes there are people who have a birth-given talent,
                                however, in order to sustain a career in this industry, <b><em>hard work</em></b> is a <b><em>must</em></b>. This doesn’t mean that it can’t also be fun, just understand you have to be willing to do the work.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="network">Network with actors</h2>
                            <p>We are blessed to live in a technological age where videos, podcasts, and various apps can shower us with information. If you don’t know of any actors in your close circles, join an app like <em>Clubhouse</em> and sit in on the
                                acting rooms. You don’t even need to participate if you don’t want to! You can just sit and listen to what people in the room have to say. I urge you to bounce around to various rooms, and find people you vibe well with, and
                                then join the conversation. Ask questions, and be curious!</p>
                            <p>If you do know actors who are perhaps friends, or friends of friends – ask them out for a coffee date (or zoom date) to pick their brain. Seasoned actors generally love to help out those just joining the industry, and everyone
                                loves to give advice! Additionally, connections in this industry are vital – so the more people you meet, the better off you will be. <em>Note:</em> Make honest connections with the intention to learn as opposed to the intention
                                to be given something.</p>
                            <p>Finally, if all that seems way too daunting right now. You can start slow and listen to podcasts, YouTube videos, or even documentaries and behind-the-scenes videos on how movies are made.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="whatYouAreGoodAt">Find what you're good at</h2>
                            <p>In life you have acquired skills, whether it be mountain biking, swimming, video gaming…etc – and whether you believe it or not, these skills are going to help you in your acting career, one way or another.</p>
                            <p>These skills will be put on your resume eventually, so it’s best, while you are preparing to launch your career, you figure out what you are good at. Very often, when asked, people will say they have no skills, but this is never
                                true.</p>
                            <p>You may speak another language, or know how to do a particular accent, maybe you know bird calls or are a great cook – whatever it is – figure it out. Once you know what you are good at, start to practice and hone those skills
                                a little bit daily. You never know when a commercial, or role may require that skill.</p>
                            <p>When it comes to languages, knowing how to speak a language and how to do an accent of that language in English, is always handy. Ex: If you speak Chinese, being able to do a Chinese accent while speaking English is going to help
                                you immensely.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="studyActing">Go study acting</h2>
                            <p>In order to become an actor, you <strong><em>must</em></strong> train. This can be classes, or schooling, university, college, or even online classes. Whichever you choose, training is what will get you where you want to go. There
                                is no wrong answer when it comes to which kind of training you choose, but this will make or break you.</p>
                            <p>I am not fond of there being “hard rules” in this industry, because there aren’t any, really. However, on this blog, there is ONLY ONE rule – <strong>train. Train. TRAIN!</strong></p>
                            <p>You may be saying to yourself, “Well A list actors don’t train” – many do, however, if an A-list actor is working on set consistently, they are still working and training their acting muscles, so in fact – yes, they are training.</p>
                            <p>I think you get the point – GO TRAIN!</p>
                            <p>Google “Acting Classes” near you, no matter where you are, something will pop up. Many acting schools and classes allow students to <em>audit</em> classes, which means, you can go in and sit in a class to see how the coaches/teachers
                                work and what is expected of students. Very often audits are free, and on occasion, there is a small fee.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="headshots">Headshots</h2>
                            <p>Headshots are photos of yourself, that introduce you to the acting world. You will want to get these professionally done – they are an investment. A good headshot can get you in a room with very little experience, so it is worth
                                saving up some money to get good ones. However, play within your budget. If you can only afford the 100$ photographer at the moment, do that! Headshots can be changed as early as every year, and as late as every 5, as long
                                as you still look like yourself in them. <em>NOTE:</em> If the shot is good enough to get you into the room, you best believe you want the chops to back it up! (See Tip 4)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="beYourAgent">Be your own agent</h2>
                            <p>Once you have trained, got your headshots, and understand the basic functions of what is expected of you as an actor, it’s time to put yourself out there. This means becoming your own agent.</p>
                            <p>Very often, new actors receive the tip to “get an agent” right out of the gate. Many agencies will not consider you if you don’t have any experience or any way to show your talent or work ethic. This is why a great way to advance
                                your chances is to PUT THE WORK IN (See Tip 1) and get yourself some indie gigs!</p>
                            <p>Check out websites like mandy.com, castingworkbook.com, backstage.com, and others, where you can create a profile, apply to projects yourself and keep an eye on casting calls.</p>
                            <p><em>NOTE:</em> I strongly suggest staying off websites like Kijiji or Craigslist, they are not always safe and not industry standard.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="demoReel">Create a demo reel</h2>
                            <p>A demo reel is a series of short clips of your work as an actor. It shows what you are capable of and how you look on screen. Very often new actors will put class work on their demos, and though that is completely acceptable, you
                                can make yourself stand out by putting in a little bit more work.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, just like most working markets, the “work cycle” applies to the acting industry. The good old question “how do I get work without a resume, and how do I get a resume without work” does still apply here. However –
                                there is a gorgeous loophole! YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN WORK!</p>
                            <p>Though this might sound daunting, creating a minute, two-person scene, and filming it with a friend is very doable. Or, if you worry about your writing skills, you can always do a scene from a known film – just be sure to put your
                                own spin on it. If you can include any of your talents within these scenes, that’s a bonus!</p>
                            <p>The whole purpose of a demo reel is to have casting directors, directors and agents see you on camera – so be creative and put together something that your proud of. As time progresses, you will book work and be able to change
                                your demo to produced work, however for the time being – putting together something yourself will make you stand out from the pack.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="agent">Get an agent</h2>
                            <p>The tip you have all been waiting for. By the time you have headshots, and a demo – AND YOU’VE TRAINED, you can now scope out an agent. The reason this is the last tip is that every tip before this one will help you land an agent.
                       </p>
        
                            <p>Though I will always suggest you aim high, in this case, I would start with looking at boutique agencies that have fewer people on their roster. The reason for this is that they will have more time and energy to focus on growing
                                your career.</p>
                            <p>Very often, new actors who sign with huge agencies get lost in the shuffle, since the large agencies are focusing on their A-listers. With that being said, do apply to those agencies, you may as well – the worst thing that happens
                                is they say no.</p>
                                <p>When looking for an agent, there are many things to look out for, frankly, that’s a whole blog post in itself, which you can find here <a href="/8-things-to-avoid-in-an-acting-agent">Check out 8 Things to Avoid in an Acting Agent</a> However, the best tip I can give
                                you is to make sure you get along with the person you are signing with.</p>
                            <p>As a new actor, you will likely want someone who is friendly, and able to hold your hand as you maneuver the vast acting world. As such, you want to make sure you get along with them and are comfortable having a business relationship
                                with your agent.</p>
                                <p>Just remember that becoming an actor takes a lot of patience in time, even after you have done these steps, there are a lot of challenges and continual upkeep you will have to do. Becoming an actor is a commitment to the craft, and to the lifestyle. It may be a tumultuous journey, but keep your head high, and put the time in. You got this! </p>

You may just be getting started, but if you are in this for the long haul, you will allow yourself patience and understanding as you grow and develop in this industry.  This really is the case where slow and steady wins the race! (And fun fact, the race is life - not the job!)  </p>

                <p>Unfortunately, there are people out there who will use your eagerness to chase your dreams, as a means to scam you. These sort of people are salesmen and are only looking to use you to get a few dollars. It’s better to be your own representative until you find a legitimate agent than to sign with one of these scam agencies.</p>
                <p>Below are some things to look out for when meeting or looking for agents. If you have already signed with an agent and want to know what practices are right or wrong - check out <a href="/5-things-to-expect-from-your-talent-agent">5 THINGS TO EXPECT FROM YOUR TALENT AGENT</a></p>

                    <p>As talented as you are, an agent will not be reaching out to you out of the blue. Agents are incredibly busy with their current talent, and though it may be a blow to your ego - they just don’t care enough about you, to reach out if you don’t have experience.</p>
                    <p>There is a romanticization in the industry about “being found”, and it’s best to nip that idea in the bud early, as it’s just not true. Frankly, it’s an idea formed by laziness, that you won’t have to do any work to be discovered. So with that in mind, if you aren’t going to be found - those claiming that you have been, are likely trying to scam you.</p>

                    <p>These scam agents’ jobs are really to collect an abundance of talent so that they can make money. They really don’t care about you as a person or your career. So it is likely, they won’t care to meet you or get to know you at all after reaching out. A common practice is to get you to sign a contract and change your representation status very quickly, so they make sure you are on their roster.</p>
                    <p>The good news is, it’s very easy to test out if you are interacting with this sort of agent. Simply ask them if they are willing to have a meeting to discuss compatibility, your prior works, and your career moving forward. Most scam agents won’t take the time for this, they will try to find a way out of the meeting, and pressure you to sign a contract.</p>
                    <p>It is rare, but I have heard of some scam agents who will meet you. Usually, these meetings take place in a location outside of their office, like a hotel, or an office that is “under construction”. They will bring the contract for you to sign on the spot, which is not industry standard. A good way to sway this type of meeting is to ask to meet at their office, during work hours, and ask to take the contract home so you can read it over.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionThree"> THEY PROMISE YOU WORK  </h2>
                    <p>Another wonderful untrue idea is that an agent can get you a job. They are a means to a job, yes, but they have no pull in getting you the “Lead in a feature film”. Or getting you “on set with Brad Pitt.”  If anyone promises you a booking - they are lying. This is one of the biggest red flags that scam agents use, and unfortunately, one of the lies that really excites new actors.</p>
                    <p>As a metaphor - an agent is a dating app - they cannot promise you will meet the love of your life, fall in love, and live happily ever after. They simply can present you with options (auditions) and hope the stars align.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionFour"> THEY MAKE  YOU  BUY THEIR PORTFOLIO </h2>
                    <p>Upon meeting an agent, <strong><em>no money should be exchanged</em></strong>. It is very common that scam agencies will tell you you have to purchase their headshot package in order to get started. Or you have to take their recommended acting classes in order to be seen. This is not how the industry works.</p>
                    <p>Sure, an agent may recommend you shoot with a certain photographer, or take classes with a specific teacher - but none of that costs money. It’s your choice in the end, who will shoot your headshots and who you will train with. Your agent gets no money for either of those things.</p>
                    <p>Another common thing scam agents will do is say they have a “business fee” which covers all printing, and online workings of your casting profiles. Another lie. Your agent will be paid when you book a job, <strong><em>that’s it</em>.</strong> Which introduces the next point -</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionFive"> THEY TAKE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OFF YOUR PAYCHEQUE </h2>
                    <p>Some scam agencies are more clever than others. Some know that new actors have been warned of the signs, and so they have adjusted their way of scamming. One way is to take a higher percentage of your paycheque, this removes the “fee” red flag from their dealings.</p>
                    <p>It does depend on where you live, and you can search the proper percentages of your local area online. However, in the U.S., U.K., and Australia, the standard is 10%, any more than that and you are likely dealing with a scam agency. In Canada, there are different percentages depending on what medium you have booked. The standard is 15%, however, for print, it can be 20% and for theatre, it can be 10%.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionSix"> THEY NAME DROP SUCCESS STORIES </h2>
                    <p>Listen, we can all be proud of our successes, and for agents, their talent succeeding is definitely something to brag about. However, any name in the industry that you would recognize - won’t be bragged about by some agent that reached out to you. <em>Jennifer Lawrence’s agent is not scouting for new actors.</em></p>
                    <p>Additionally, an agent meeting is not the place for “others” successes. It’s about you and the agent’s relationship, and quite frankly, the focus should solely be on you. If they don’t want to get to know you and are dropping famous names in every other sentence, you can be sure, they are trying to scam you.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionSeven"> THEY HAVE A SIDE HUSTLE AS WELL </h2>
                    <p>Yes, times are hard. As a new actor, you are probably more familiar with that than most. However, an established agent will be doing just fine and will not require a “side-hustle”. More importantly, they will not be letting you know they have one.</p>
                    <p>You best believe, if an agent is telling you what other things they do for work, they are telling you upfront they won’t be putting your needs first. You want an agent who will be hungry to get you auditions and hope you succeed, so if they are telling you about their “protein drink business” you can also be a part of - Run. No one likes a pyramid scheme, especially when it’s coming from someone who is looking to be your agent!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionEigth"> THEY NEED TO ADVERTISE THEIR AGENCY </h2>
                    <p>Agents don’t advertise. It’s as simple as that. Not on the radio, not online, nowhere. If you see an ad for an agency, do not apply.</p>
                    <p>In fact, in Canada talent agents have a code of ethics that they should be following. One of the points in that code of ethics is “An agent will not advertise to the general public for the purpose of soliciting clients.” If you live outside of Canada, it is very likely your state or province has something similar that holds agents to an ethical standard.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="summary-li">
                <h2 id="summary" >Summary</h2>
                <p>It may seem that getting an agent is a little scary, however, it’s better to know what is out there and be prepared. One of the reasons I am so adamant about training, (which you can see in <a href="/8-tips-on-how-to-become-an-actor">8 TIPS ON HOW TO BECOME AN ACTOR</a>) is that not only does it prepare you with the skill of acting, but it also is a barrier against these scam agents. Scam agencies do not want someone who knows what they are doing. Training also allows you a safe community to talk to other actors about their experiences with agencies and agents, which is another method that keeps you safe.</p>
                </li>

                    <p>The blog below is going to prepare you for the practices of a good agent, and what you can expect. If you want to know what practices you can do to be a good client, see <a href="/6-ways-to-have-a-better-relationship-with-your-agent">(6 WAYS TO HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR AGENT)</a></p>

                            <h2 id="sectionOne"> THEY COMMUNICATE WELL </h2>
                            <p>One of the bases of all great relationships is communication. A great agent will know how to communicate effectively. They will respond to your emails and phone calls promptly. Additionally, they will be clear on what they are communicating. With all the tools that email platforms have now a day (highlighting, bolding, italicizing, snooze, schedule send..etc), it makes it very easy for an agent to be clear and prompt.</p>
                            <p><em> What shouldn’t happen:  </em></p>
                            <p>You should never receive an email from your agent that is a stream of consciousness, all in caps or unclear. If you don’t know the purpose of the email, or you aren’t sure what to do with the information, they aren’t doing their job correctly.</p>
                            <p><strong><em> Example of Good Communication  </em></strong></p>
                            <img src="../assets/images/5-things-to-expect-from-your-talent-agent/good example.PNG" alt="example of good communication from an acting agent">
                            <p><strong><em> Example of Bad Communication  </em></strong></p>
                            <img src="../assets/images/5-things-to-expect-from-your-talent-agent/bad example.PNG" alt="example of bad communication from an acting agent">

                            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL  </h2>
                            <p>It is easy to forget that the relationship with your agent is a business relationship. Over time, and as you get to know them better, it can become more friendly, however, there always does need to be a sense of professionalism and respect. This means they speak to you as they would speak to someone they work with.</p>
                            <p>To put it in a different light, let’s just say - if you would report HR on them in a 9 - 5 job, then it’s unacceptable in this situation as well.</p>
                            <p>The only exception to this is if you are both discussing anything to do with changing your look, size charts, and something that may directly affect your appearance. In this industry, appearance does play a part, but this conversation should be consensual on both sides and dealt with respect as well.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionThree"> THERE IS A MONEY TRAIL </h2>
                            <p>When you book a job, your agent will be handling the payment side of things. They will take their cut, and then send the money off to you. A good agency and legitimate agent will have a breakdown on how much you received, what their cut was, taxes, and any other breakdown on where the money goes. You should be privy to all that information.</p>
                            <p>If an agent is not paying you, e-transfering you random amounts, or behind on payments, you need to assess whether or not your agent/agency is any good.</p>
                            <p>These rules may vary depending on what province or state you are in, however, typically:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A non-union job has between 30 - 90 days to get you your payment</li>
                                <li>A union job has 2 weeks to get you your payment</li>
                                <li>An agent has 7 days to receive their cut and send the cheque on to you</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFour"> THEY HOLD THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE </h2>
                            <p>Another wonderful trait that serves well in everyday life is accountability. It is particularly important that your agent has this personality trait. The last thing you want is someone blaming you for their mistakes, the industry is stressful enough.</p>
                            <p>Now listen, there are a lot of irons in the fire when you are an agent. They are handling as little as, auditions, tapes, and bookings and as much as agency meetings, casting phone calls, contracts, booking conflicts…etc. So it’s likely that here or there, a mistake may be made. If they apologize and correct it, you can assume you have a good agent representing you.</p>
                            <p>If however, they start making up excuses as to why the error happened, or who was to blame, or you feel there is a gossipy element to their reasoning, you may be represented by someone who doesn’t have your best interest in mind.</p>
                            <p><strong><em> Example of an Acting Agent That is Not Accountable  </em></strong></p>
                            <img src="../assets/images/5-things-to-expect-from-your-talent-agent/not accountable.PNG" alt="example of an acting agent that is not accountable">

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFive">  THEY SUPPORT YOU AND YOUR CAREER </h2>
                            <p>Your agent doesn’t need to hold your hand, by any means, but you want to feel supported in your relationship with your agent. You want to feel seen, and that you are both fighting for the same cause: YOUR CAREER.</p>
                            <p>If you are putting in the work, you should feel they are as well. You should feel confident asking your agent questions about the industry. Additionally, there should be a sense that they are pushing and rooting for you. If your agent is getting you “pushes” for certain roles or fights to get you an audition. You can best believe they have your career in mind.</p>
                            <p> On the flip side of this, your agent should also understand your need for time off and living your life as well. You should be able to book out any time you need, be it for personal reasons or events in your life. You are not a machine, and a good agent will understand this.</p>
                            <p>The same goes for declining parts. Assuming you don’t go around declining every audition you get, your agent should be happy with you regretting an audition, particularly if it’s a role you don’t feel comfortable doing.</p>
                        </li>

                        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
                        <p>At the end of the day, you want to find someone you get along with, and want to work with. You don’t need to see your entire future with them, there are agents who are stepping stones, but even an agent who is bringing you to the next level should add value to your career at that point in time. If you feel your agent is lacking in one of these categories, communicate that with them. All relationships require work - be sure to put the effort in to make this one flourish as well.

                    <p>There are three different beliefs when it comes to agent-client relationships. There is the belief that your agent works for you, the belief that you work for your agent, and the belief that it is an equal business partnership.</p>
                    <p>I personally am of the opinion of #3, the equal business partnership. I think this version of looking at the relationship allows both parties to bring their strengths and in turn create a successful future for your career.</p>
                    <p>My hope is you are here because you want to create a positive dynamic between you and your agent, and you want to know what is expected of you in this relationship. My fear is that some of you have come under false intentions to push your agent to work for you. A brief reminder that your intentions are also very important when it comes to solidifying a strong relationship with your agent.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionOne"> BE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT OPPoRTUNITY </h2>
                            <p>As an actor, you never know when your next opportunity (be it audition or booking) will come. It is a world we have very little control over. But, what you do have control over is your preparation. This means, train - so that when the audition comes you can deliver your best work.</p>
                            <p>This also means, having your demo reels, headshots, resumes, websites up to date. If your agent doesn’t need to chase you for this information, you make their job a lot easier.</p>
                            <p>Being prepared also means doing a thorough job on your auditions. Put the work into your auditions and submit your self-tapes before the deadline.</p>
                            <p>Be someone that your agent can count on, as opposed to someone who they have to babysit. Additionally, if you are prepared and your agent feels they are in good hands when working with you, you have already given them a reason to push and fight for you. Many agents have large rosters, so don’t give them a reason to pick someone else to fight for.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> PRIORITIZE TIME MANAGEMENT  </h2>
                            <p>It is very likely that you will be asked to audition several times a week. Being organized means you can handle your auditions, bookings, side jobs, and personal life. It means you are able to get your audition in before the deadline, while also working your side job, because you know how to handle your schedule.</p>
                            <p>Knowing your schedule is helpful when you get Availability Checks for bookings. It is also possible you will book more than one job at a time. (I wish this for all of you) It’s important you know when those outside dates for both jobs are, in case there are any overlaps. Additionally, some of you have more than one agent, in more than one country, so knowing the scheduling of your bookings and communicating them to your agents is very important.</p>
                            <p>Another organizational skill that can be very handy, is keeping track of your auditions. ( <a href="/14-things-to-keep-track-of-when-you-auditions">See  14 THINGS TO KEEP TRACK OF WHEN YOU AUDITION</a> for a more in-depth look at what to keep track of) If you have an understanding at the end of the year of who’s auditioned you, and how many auditions you’ve had. You can have a discussion with your agent on who you’d like to see more of, and what direction you want your next year to go.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionThree"> GET TO KNOW YOUR TALENT AGENT </h2>
                            <p>This point goes beyond the industry, and beyond your career - though it may very well help your career. Your agent is human and one of the best ways to nurture this client-agent relationship is to treat them as such. Your agent will have interests, and hobbies that go beyond the industry, and knowing these things can come in handy when events such as the holidays come up.</p>
                            <p>Now I’m not saying you need to inorganically create moments to find these things out, however, when given the opportunity, it’s always good to ask questions and find out more about them. If you are someone who wants to follow their agent on social media, this is also a great way to see what their interests are.</p>
                            <p>Another really good reason to do this is that if you know what kind of person your agent is, this allows you to better communicate with them.</p>
                            <p>Here is a story I find quite charming:</p>
                            <p>A colleague of mine was in the habit of sending bottles of wine to his representation around the holidays. One day, he was talking to his agent and casually he asked: Did you find the Merlot this year better or worse than last year’s? The agent paused and said: I don’t know… I actually don’t drink wine - but my assistant loved it.  It turns out, in the seven years my colleague was represented by his agent, he didn’t realize his agent didn’t drink wine! You can imagine the embarrassment. Thankfully, it was all in good fun, and it sparked the conversation “well what do you like?” and my colleague found out his agent loved IPA’s.</p>
                            <p>Though this story ended with an inside joke and a closer relationship - it can also save you 7 years of bad gift giving!</p>
                            <p>Let me be clear, getting to know them is not only for gift giving. It comes in handy when you know how they prefer to communicate (email/text/phone),  when they answer emails, which topics are out of bounds…etc.  All these things, will help bring you two closer together - and in turn create a powerful relationship in which your career can blossom from.</p>

                            <h2 id="sectionFour"> KNOW WHEN TO COMMUNICATE AND WHEN TO BE PATIENT </h2>
                            <p>For new actors who have recently signed with an agent, it may seem daunting knowing when to contact your agent and when not to. The answer to this is:  don’t be afraid to contact them.</p>
                            <p>There are however reasons to contact them that are better than others.</p>
                            <p><b><em>Good Reasons</em></b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>You have a question about an audition, a booking, or something they can answer that you don’t know </li>
                                <li>You are on hold, and the date is a day away and you haven’t heard whether you booked it or have been released</li>
                                <li>You are on set and something has come up that you didn’t know about, or expect. (I.e. Nudity) </li>
                                <li>You are booking out </li>
                                <li>Someone contacted you for work but didn’t go through your agent. </li>
                                <li>An emergency - whether it be something happened to you or a loved one, and you need to take some sudden time off. </li>
                                <li>You got new headshots, or cut together a new demo reel and want feedback</li>
                                <li>You want to have a yearly meeting to go over goals</li>
                                <li>You saw an audition that you want to submit for</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b><em>Not So Good Reasons</em></b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To check and see if they heard back about an audition</li>
                                <li>To ask them why you haven’t gotten any auditions in a while</li>
                                <li>To ask questions that you can answer yourself - (i.e. to interpret a character or what you should wear for an audition) </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This point should not make you fear reaching out to your agent, but it should make you think about how you are using their time the most effectively. Certain agents are more gracious at holding their actor's hands, and others would prefer you took initiative. The best way to figure this out is by asking them what they prefer.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFive"> UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR ACTING AGENT DOES </h2>
                            <p>Knowing what your agent does will also help you understand what you are supposed to do. The easiest way to find out this information is to ask them when you have your first meeting. Some agencies delegate different jobs to different agents. Others, the agent may be doing everything from getting auditions to accounting.</p>
                            <p>In the states, actors have managers and agents. Both do very different jobs. If you are unaware of what those are - it works in your best interest to ask them. Your manager may deal with certain aspects of your career, while your agent deals with others. If you know what they do, you will know who to go to with any questions you have.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionSix"> BE AVAILABLE FOR AUDITIONS AND BOOKINGS </h2>
                            <p>I am always astounded at how often I hear actors turning down auditions. It is in your right to turn down auditions, yes. However, it is in your best interest in booking work, NOT TO.</p>
                            <p>Part of the reason I believe many actors, particularly new ones, turn down auditions is that they don’t recognize the weight of getting one.</p>
                            <p>When you get an audition you have already won.</p>
                            <p>What I mean by that is, you have been personally selected from hundreds of applications to audition for this part. The casting director saw your headshot, (and maybe your demo reel) and thought you could play that part. So - make yourself available.</p>
                            <p>Particularly now where practically every audition is a self-tape, do your best to make the time Also, after a certain amount of declines, your agent will feel submitting you is a waste of their time, and your auditions will decrease. Not out of spite for you, but they will turn their attention to someone more deserving of their time.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="summary-li">
                        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
                        <p>If you have any doubt about any of these points, the one to drive home is the golden rule: don’t be a jerk. Being someone who is pleasant to work with goes a long way. You can be disorganized, or occasionally not be fully prepared, but as long as you are hitting deadlines, trying your best and being kind, your agent will thank you. </p>
                        <p>As one final takeaway;, I have heard actors say that “the agent hasn’t put the work in to get to know me so why should I.”  My personal opinion on this matter is the following:  Your agent has 20,30, maybe even 50 more people they are managing. If you want them to put the effort into getting to know you, you should show them why it is worth it. If you aren’t willing to do that, ask yourself which of the following beliefs from above you have - 1 ,2 or 3.  </p>
                        </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Wishing you a great relationship with your agent(s)!</h3>

                    <p>Keeping track of the facts of your auditions is important for growth, and goal setting. Many actors believe they can just remember certain information, like what casting directors brought them in, or what they’ve auditioned for. However, without a proper way of cataloging these facts - you can lose sight of them very quickly.</p>
                    <p>You can either make your own Audition Book, or you can purchase one, like the linked below. 
                    <div class="cta"></div>
                </p>
                    <p>Below are the various things you should keep track of when auditioning, and why.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionOne"> Date & Time of Audition </h2>
                            <p>This one seems pretty self-explanatory. Having the date you auditioned, not only helps you see how many auditions you got in a week/month/ year, but also allows you to categorize your auditions chronologically.</p>
                            <p>The time can vary. If it is a self-tape, put the time it is due by - that helps you remember the due date. If it is a ZOOM or In-Person audition, put the time you are called in for.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> Type of Audition </h2>
                            <p>With the various types of ways to audition now, be it in the room, zoom, voice-over mp3, or selftape, it’s good to keep a log as to what type of audition is expected of you, and what you sent in/or attended.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Casting Director / Casting House </h2>
                            <p>As you create various relationships with casting, it’s important to know who is bringing you in, how frequently you’re seen by them, and then alternatively who isn’t bringing you in. At the end of the year, when you set your goals, you can let your agent know which casting agents you’d like to see more of.</p>
                            <p>Knowing who brings you in is also a great way to feel good about the work you do - if a casting director consistently brings you in, they like your work! Additionally, if you notice a certain casting director bringing you in quite a bit, at the end of the year it doesn’t hurt to send them a holiday card, to show your appreciation.</p>
                            <p>Certain casting houses have more than one casting director, if that is the case, make sure you put both the name of the casting house, and which casting director was the one who brought you in.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFour"> Network  / Production Company </h2>
                            <p>Knowing this information is very important when auditioning because it lets you know the mood and genre of the audition. It’s also important in terms of tracking it.</p>
                            <p>If you are auditioning constantly for Netflix or Hallmark, this tells you where casting sees you and can be helpful in training. Either, you train to feed into your strengths and/or you work to train and shape your career to go out for networks and companies you want to be seen by, (if what you are going out for isn’t to your liking).</p>
                            <p>Additionally, if you are auditioning for commercials, this is a good place to put which product is auditioning you. Since many companies have different ads going around - you can put the company name here, and the type of commercial audition under the project name. For ex: COMPANY - McDonalds PROJECT NAME - McNuggets</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFive"> Director & Previous Works </h2>
                            <p>Just like all the other points above, if you notice that you keep seeing the same director, this is a good indicator that they like your work, or you are going out for similar projects. Knowing the director and their previous works allows you to get an understanding on who you could be working with. A quick IMDB check of their previous credits, and a quick YouTube of a trailer of their work is always helpful. If there isn’t anything, that’s okay - there is no harm in putting their name down, to see if there is a trend.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionSix"> Writer & Previous Works </h2>
                            <p>Same reasoning applies here as with the Director notes above. However, it’s always good to see if the Director and the Writer are the same person. If this is the case, it’s good to pay extra attention to the words of the script, because the person you are auditioning for is auditioning to fill the roles of their baby (i.e. The script)</p>
                            <p>Seeing what a writer's previous works are also allows you to see what their genre of work generally entails. If you can recognize some of the previous work, it may give you an understanding of the world the writer lives in.</p>
                        </li>

                            <h2 id="sectionSeven"> Project Name </h2>
                            <p>Another pretty evident reason why you want this in your logging. 
                       </p>
                            <p>One thing to keep in mind here, many auditions, unless an already running show, may have a working title, for secrecy or because they haven’t found a name for it yet. Your agent may have an idea what the actual title of the show or film is. If they don’t, that’s okay - leave some room for what the title actually becomes. This way, if you don’t book it, but end up seeing it later on TV, you can make a comparison to your audition and the actual show. 
                       </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionEight"> Role Name </h2>
                            <p>Who are you auditioning for - What is their name? This will directly correlate to your sides.</p>
                            <p>If you are auditioning for a commercial, and you are simply MALE HERO - that is still important to include.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionNine"> Role Type </h2>
                            <p>You can write whether it’s a PRINCIPAL/ GUEST STAR/ LEAD… etc if it is listed. Or you can list what sort of character it is: “30s’ Biker” for example. You are more than welcome to add both, so you can see if there is a trend in what you go out for.</p>
                            <p>This can help for training - you are able to see what “type’ you are being seen for, and work on playing into that, or alternatively work to train against that so you can go out for parts you want to go out for.</p>
                            <p>Keep in mind also, what you are going out for may also have something to do with your headshots <a href="http://localhost:5000/5-things-to-know-about-headshots">(SEE 5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT HEADSHOTS</a> for more details about this point)</p>

                            <h2 id="sectionTen"> Personal Notes </h2>
                            <p>The personal notes section is entirely up to you. Many actors like to write their feelings about the audition, whether they felt it went well, what they wore, how they were feeling before, if anything happened during, before or after that may have altered how the audition went… etc. This is up to you to pick how thorough you want to be.</p>
                            <p>These notes are particularly useful if you get a callback, you can decide whether you want to wear the same thing, or look back and see what your headspace was at the time of the audition.</p>
                            <p>One of the things that I would suggest you do, is make any notes about things you may have discussed in the audition that didn’t have to do with the audition itself. If you spoke to the casting director about their favorite music, or the director told you about their dog, these are all good things to write down, in order to remember them down the road. 
                       </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionEleven"> Feedback </h2>
                            <p>This category may rarely get used. It isn’t very frequently that you will receive feedback from casting - however, your agent may give you a comment or two. So - it is worth writing down, if not only for your ego, to remember good things said about your work. And, as always if there is constructive feedback, this is something you can take into your next audition to allow growth.</p>
                            <p>The odd time you do receive feedback, this could be from a director or casting telling you how to alter your callback or tape for a better chance of being considered for the role. Sometimes when we audition we don’t understand the genre or the type of comedy/drama needed, and can feedback can get us on the right track.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionTwelve"> Callbacks, Holds & Bookings </h2>
                            <p>If you are creating your own notebook. Find a fun way to mark these three. I personally enjoy stamps, so I have three different stamps, with different coloured ink that I use when I get any one of these. The stamps make it easy for me to see where I got callbacks, holds and bookings and how often. It doesn’t have to be stamps however, it can be stickers, highlighters, smiley faces, whatever brings you joy.</p>
                            <p>If you bought the audition book, you can simply check off, or highlight the box in order to keep track.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionThirteen"> Catalogue Number </h2>
                            <p>There are two types of cataloging that you should have within your audition book. You should number the audition WITHIN THE YEAR. For example: #3 (within the year 2022) and you should number the audition OVERALL. For example #245 (between the year 2017 - 2022) This way you can see how many auditions you have ever done and how many auditions you did that year alone.</p>
                            <p>Generally the yearly number goes beside the date, and the overall  number goes at the bottom of the audition, but there is no right way to do this.</p>
                            <p>I personally also like to number my sides as well, and give them a number alongside my audition number. Since some auditions, generally commercials, tend to be SOC (silent on camera) there are no sides that come along with it. So the audition number, and the sides number can differ.</p>
                            <p>You don’t need to number your sides if you aren’t printing them and keeping them. However, if you do keep them, even electronically, it may be worth giving them a number.</p>
                            <p>If you are printing your sides and breakdowns, and keeping them in an additional binder, numbering them in accordance with your overall audition number and your sides number can be very useful if you want to go back to your sides on a later date. Let me give you an example, as this may sound very confusing, but I promise you it isn’t.</p>
                            <p><strong><em> EXAMPLE: </em></strong></p>
                            <p>The audition is for <em>THE WITCHER</em> -</p>
                            <p>It is your <strong>289th</strong> audition of your entire career.</p>
                            <p>It is the <strong>148th</strong> audition that has had sides.</p>
                            <p>So - at the end of your audition logging you would write:</p>
                            <p> <strong>#289 S#148</strong>  (s for sides)</p>
                            <p>You would also write those numbers on your sides & the breakdown if you print them out, so that you can find them later in your binder and tie them back to your notebook.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFourteen"> The Yearly Tally </h2>
                            <p> If you are making your own notebook, you can decide whether you want this at the beginning or end of your notebook.</p>
                            <p><strong><em>Your yearly tally should have:</em></strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>how many auditions you had in the year</li>
                                <li>how many were commercials, film, tv</li>
                                <li>how many callbacks you had</li>
                                <li>how many holds</li>
                                <li>how many bookings </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>And anything additional you find pertinent information for your growth and goal setting. 
                       </p>
                            <p>If you have bought the notebook linked above, you will notice that it is the very first page of your notebook. This way makes it easier to a) remember you have to fill it in at the end of the year b) makes it easier to find if you go looking for it.</p>

                    <p> 
                    <p><em>What is a headshot?</em> A headshot is a professional photo of your face, generally shoulders up, that looks like you. It’s purpose is to get you into the audition room. Long story short - a headshot is your business card.  A good headshot will be memorable enough to get you into various rooms, generic enough that it looks like you most of the time, and specific enough to slot you into various role categories. </p>
                    <p><em>What do I need them for?</em> Most importantly, headshots are used to “sell” you to casting directors. This means agents (or yourself if you are not represented) use the photo to persuade casting directors to get you into the room for an audition. In situations like open calls,your headshot is also used to remember what you looked like when you've entered the room. </p>
                    <p>Now, in our predominantly online world, headshots are also used for casting websites and marketing purposes. If you are being sent out for audition submissions by your agent online, your only method to getting an audition is your headshot. Some people post their headshots on their social media platforms as well. </p>
                    <p>Now that we’ve summarized what they are, here are some things you should know about headshots if you are going to get them done, or already have. 
                     </p> </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionOne"> What You See is What You Get </h2>
                            <p> Casting directors are incredibly busy, they don’t have the time to imagine what you can go out for,so what your photo evokes is likely what role you will audition for. For example: If you look angelic and innocent in your headshot, the roles you go out for will likely be in that vein. This is why you want to figure out a) what you want to go out for and b) what kind of roles you naturally look like.   </p>
                            <p> If your A and B don’t match up, then deliberately curate your headshots so that you have options for both.  </p>
                            <p> If you have a “harder” look but you want to be cast in Hallmark movies, then find ways you can make your look softer, and more innocent, and vice versa. If you have a very innocent look, but you want to play “grungier” roles, put together a wardrobe,make up or aesthetic that would persuade a viewer in that direction.  </p>
                            <p> It is important that before you go to your headshot session you have thought about what kind of photos you want by the end of the session.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> They Have to Look Like You </h2>
                            <p> A very common misconception with new actors when they are told to “curate” their headshots, is they show up as someone else.  </p>
                            <p> Your headshots <em>must</em> look like you.  </p>
                            <p> A great rule to follow is: If the casting director bumped into you first thing in the morning before you showered or put on your face, they would recognize you. Essentially, your headshot is a slightly glamorized version of your natural self.  </p>
                            <p> The curation of a headshot is subtle. It could be the difference between a collared shirt or a leather jacket. Natural make- up vs. darker eye-shadow.  </p>
                            <p> You can do whatever you want, but my suggestion is, leave the hair extensions, fake eyelashes, and toupees, at home. Or, bring them for ONE of your shots, for variety, but don’t have them in all your photos. Now, if you are a woman of color and you wear hair pieces everyday, then this is where you can ignore that suggestion.   </p>
                            <p> When it comes to glasses, if you wear them all the time, bring them to your headshot session. Take some photos with them, and take some photos without. Additionally, if you have facial hair, you should take photos with it, and some without. It is extremely common for casting directors to  ask for a photo of you clean shaven.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Headshots Are an Invesment </h2>
                            <p> Since headshots are your first impression with casting, it’s important that you have a professional photo. Many actors find the pricing of headshots to be quite a difficult bill to swallow, however if there is any cost worth spending, it’s on good headshots. If you get shots you like, you can use them for 3-5 years, or more if your look doesn’t change.  </p>
                            <p> With that being said, this doesn’t mean spending $1,500 on headshots because the price gets you the best photo. It simply means, don’t take a selfie and pass it off as a headshot. I have seen new actors crop group photos, or use passport photos as their headshots - <b>don’t do that</b>. Go to a studio with a photographer who knows what they're doing. Lighting, poses, and an understanding of what type of photo you want will greatly increase getting great results.   </p>
                            <p> I would strongly recommend hiring a makeup artist. Don’t assume just because you do your make up everyday that you can do make up for a professional shoot. </p>
                            <p> This is why headshots are considered an investment, because you are not only paying for your photos, you are paying for your make-up, your edits and prints.  </p>
                            <p> But at the end of the day, these photos will hopefully get you into the audition room, which is one step closer to booking the job, and paying that investment off!  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFour"> Commercial Photos vs. Theatrical Photos </h2>
                            <p> If you are tight for money, and can only get two different looks in your headshot session, make sure you get one commercial shot and one theatrical shot.  </p>
                            <p> A commercial shot is a photo that looks entirely like you, natural and “family friendly”. A good indicator of a commercial photo is something you would see in stock photography. You look like you are someone people want to work with, and a company would want you as the face of their product.  </p>
                            <p> A theatrical photo is one that fits into more of a character category. These photos are used for film, tv and theater, where the photo indicates a lean towards a genre or type of person. An example I keep going back to is “biker” but it can also be “business professional” “student” “mother” “villain” “blue collar worker” etc etc.  </p>
                            <p> The main way you would curate these two shots is by wardrobe. A business professional look would likely have a blazer or a collared shirt. A harder look may involve a leather jacket, or a sleeveless top. The other way is by how you pose in the photo, but more of that in subsequent points below.  </p>
                            <p> A wonderful way to understand these various looks is to look up headshots on Pinterest. Make a board of the looks you want to replicate in your headshot session. It’s an easy way to figure out what kind of wardrobe, make up and poses you want to bring in.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFive"> Your Eyes are the Windows to … the Room </h2>
                            <p> A good headshot has “something about it”. Generally this “something” comes from the thoughts that are behind your eyes. They say that the eyes are the windows to the soul, and as such, your thoughts in your photo give the viewer a glimpse of that.  </p>
                            <p> If you look at a headshot and you wonder “what is that person thinking” or “what was going on when they took that photo”, that is memorable. That is what will make you stand out.  </p>
                            <p> Very often new actors will get headshots and the proofs show a “deer in the headlights” look or a “dead look”, which often comes from a discomfort or fear during the session. A way to combat these issues, and make sure you get your money’s worth from your headshot session, is to prepare thoughts.  </p>
                            <p> These thoughts should come through your eyes. They can be anything you want. My suggestion is you think thoughts towards the camera, as if they are a character. “I like you” “I will get you” “I am better than you”...etc.  The viewer won’t know what you were thinking, but they will know there is something captivating about your headshot, and that is the goal!  </p>
                            <p> In an earlier point, I mentioned posing. The reason posing is not it’s own point, is because there are in fact very few poses you will do in a headshot session due to the photo being shoulder or chest up. This is why, if you focus on anything during your headshot session, it’s your eyes and the thoughts that are coming through.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="summary-li">
                        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
                        <p>There is a lot of pressure in this industry when it comes to headshots, as they are the first thing to get you into the audition room. I won’t diminish this pressure by telling you it’s not important, because they are. However, I will tell you that headshots very often speak to you and those who see it. So trust that. </p>
                        <p>Picking the right headshot can be a nightmare for some actors. You not only have to look at yourself photo after photo, but you have to narrow it down to 2 or 3. A great way to begin the narrowing down process is making sure your selections check off these points above. </p>
                        <p>If they do, start asking friends and family what their first impressions are within the first 3 seconds of seeing the image - does it check off these points for them too? This is a great way to begin your selection journey. </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Wishing you a fun filled headshot session, with great results! </h3>

    <p> You have entered a very difficult profession, there is no doubt about it. The amount of unknowns, lack of control and rejection is enough to put anyone in a stressed, depressed, angry or negative headspace. </p>

    <p>If you are a new actor, start tackling this now. Make a point of managing your thoughts about this industry now, before you become embittered.If you are a veteran actor, check yourself to see where you are in this journey. After doing this job for a while, it is very easy to be consumed by negative thoughts. The time to become aware of your thoughts is NOW, so that you can conquer them. 
    Below are five thoughts you must get a grasp of in order to benefit in all aspects of this career.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionOne"> “THEY ARE DOING BETTER THAN ME.”</h2>
            <p> Comparing your career to others will bring you nothing but pain. You are on a journey, it is entirely your journey and no one else's. The analogy that I love best is that of a garden: <i>"No one blames the tulip for blooming early or the daisy for blooming late. They bloom when they bloom and they are all essential to the garden.”</i> The same applies to acting. Some actors hit success earlier than others, this can be due to networking, timing, consistency… and a myriad of other reasons. </p>
            <p> Additionally, success is a funny thing. It not only looks different to each person, it shifts depending on where you are on your journey. To look at someone else’s career and decide they are doing better than you, is nothing more than your perspective - so change it. </p>
            <p>A great way to change this thought process is to celebrate every step of your journey.  By doing this you not only are in the moment with your progress, but you also get to look back at all the steps you took to get to where you are. When you see how far you have come, it reduces those thoughts that you aren’t doing well, because all progress is good. </p>
            <p><strong>Story:</strong></p>
            <p><i>I remember signing with my first legitimate agent so clearly. I had been represented by many fraud agencies and when I finally signed with this agency, I was over the moon. Within a week a friend of mine signed with a huge agency that represented A listers. All of sudden, my excitement towards my agency was gone. In my opinion, my friend was doing better than me, and all the progress I had made, didn’t matter to me anymore. All my comparison did was steal what previously had made me happy. A few days later, a colleague of mine was talking to me about how she had spent 6 months trying to get an agent and no one would sign her, and all she wanted was to be represented. In that moment I recognized that in someone else’s eyes, I was on the path they wanted, and I had success. I am always reminded of this when I start to doubt my path.</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> “I DESERVED THAT PART” </h2>
            <p> You don’t actually deserve anything. Though this may sound like a blunt statement, it’s a great way of removing self entitlement from your career. If you are thinking someone didn’t deserve a role, and you did - you are putting someone down or judging them to validate your feelings of jealousy, or your work ethic, or your life. That judgment is entirely all about you and your ego.</p>
            <p> The unfortunate reality is, there will always be someone better looking than you, someone who works harder than you and someone who just has more something than you. So you probably don’t deserve the part, but you can prove you are worthy of it. </p>
            <p> Being deserving versus being worthy are two very different things. They may sound very similar, but one sits on the side of being given something, and the other sits on the side of earning something. The latter is a very powerful mindset to be in. </p>
            <p> Someone who is worthy of something ( a role in this case) doesn’t expect to get the role. They know they have put the work in, that should everything work in their favor, they are the best for the part, and they will continue to prove that to their peers, colleagues, fans and (most importantly) themselves because they want to. They have faith, because they know they are worthy.</p>
            <p> To summarize, check your expectations at the door - and do the work, because you love it. You are all worthy of success, should you want to be. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionThree"> “I DIDN’T GET THE PART BECAUSE…”</h2>
            <p> I am too fat. Too Skinny. Too young. Too dark. Too pale. Too tall. Too short… etc etc etc. There is no way to end this sentence that will be correct. </p>
            <p> You actually have no idea why you didn’t book the part and truly, you never will. So stop dwelling on it. </p>
            <p> By thinking this, you are putting yourself down for reasons that are based purely on personal speculation. Unless you spoke to casting, the director, the producers, the writers and received a unanimous answer as to why, you will never know, so why torture your psyche with lies? </p>
            <p> It’s very common when you begin thinking this way, you actually go into your audition with this mindset. Even before you have sent in your audition, even before you have been told if you have booked it or not,  you have lost because you are indicating why you aren’t worthy of the part.  </p>
            <p> Psychologists for years have been talking about the importance of mindset within athletes and how drastically positive thinking curates success. The same goes for actors. </p>
            <p> I am assuming, if you are here, you want to be better at your craft and perform at a high level. This means curating a mindset that elevates you and your confidence and eliminating excuses and negativity that don’t serve you. Giving yourself reasons as to why you a) won’t book it or b) didn’t book it is a negative thinking pattern that in the long run, will hurt you. </p>
            <p> So, if this is something you find yourself thinking often - reroute the thought by:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Acknowledging it</li>
                <li>And responding with - I actually don’t know and will never know. It is out of my hands now.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you are interested in reading more about the psychology of high performers, some great references are Finding Mastery, the Michael Gervais podcast, Brendon Burchard or Carol S. Dweck </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFour"> “THAT TAKE WASN’T PERFECT.”</h2>
            <p> One more take. One more take. One more, and that will be the take.  Sound familiar? </p>
            <p> We all have this idea on how a take should look, and we hope to execute it exactly as we picture… and very often that is what we think is “the perfect take” But news flash: there is no such thing as perfection… and quite frankly, if there was, it would be boring.</p>
            <p> This “That Take Wasn’t Perfect” thought is not only one that occurs to new actors, many veteran actors think this thought as well. In fact, the more you work your craft, the pickier you will be of your takes. (The whole, the more you know the less you know syndrome) However, seeking perfection is a sure way to ruin your self-tape. </p>
            <p> Don’t worry, this is a constant work in progress for me too. </p>
            <p> A great way to combat this thought is to work on trusting your work. If you do the work and preparation in advance, that will shine through in your audition and if you trust that - you will find yourself doing less takes, and focusing less on controlling the audition, and enjoying it instead. </p>
            <p> And in fact, that’s where becoming a messy actor begins. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFive"> “THIS IS A LIFE-CHANGING AUDITION” </h2>
            <p> We all know that feeling when you get an audition for that big network, or that well known director and all of a sudden the pressure to do “the best job possible” sinks in. You begin thinking about how if you were to book this job, it could change your life. </p>
            <p> Let’s put this bluntly - if you succumb to the pressures that you have now put on yourself - you will not book this job. There is nothing worse in an audition than an actor trying to desperately get the part. Desperation stinks!</p>
            <p> So, how do you stop putting this pressure on yourself? </p>
            <p> Here are a few things to remember: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>There will always be another job</li>
                <li>You cannot control if you book this job</li>
                <li>Do the work. Trust the work. </li>
                <li>You should always be doing the best job you can on auditions… so this one is no different!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="summary-li">

        <p>If you have read this far, you have probably noticed that every point either deals with removing expectations and applying trust in yourself. If you can begin to implement this thought process in your everyday life you will start to see huge changes in your career. </p>
        </li>

    <p> Watching T.V or Film for the purpose of learning is a different part of your brain than just aimlessly watching for the sake of watching. The way to watch and learn is to make sure you have that pause finger at the ready. When you see a moment that is captivating, press pause, rewind and watch it again, and again, and again. Look for what the actor does technically that resulted in a great moment, and then make a note of it.  </p>
    <p> Today, we are going to be dissecting Red Light Green Light, Squid Game’s pilot. I could have done the entire series, but this would have resulted in a novel, instead of a blog post. Below are FIVE moments that are great acting tools to put into your acting belt. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionOne"> Seong Gi-Hub at the Horse Races</h2>
            <p><em> 6:00 min in: </em></p>
            <p> Seong Gi-Hun, (#456) played by Lee Jung-jae, goes to gamble at the horse track. The mood of a gambler is instantly captured by Lee Jung-jae’s intensity and mood swings during that scene. </p>
            <p> He starts by intensely cheering angrily at the TV screen, only to lose and he unleashes a fury and disappointment that is very evident not only in his body but in his voice. The following moment is him, gambling again, putting in his numbers at the desk - but he isn’t sure which number to bet. Such high intensity and concentration would be something easy to neglect as an actor if you aren’t reminded of how high the stakes are for gambling addicts. Each bet is life or death, and this is clearly displayed by the up and down rollercoaster of mood swings. </p>
            <p> In fact, the stakes are so high for Seong Gi Hun in this scene, that Lee Jung-jae plays that energy into Seong Gi Hun's inability to hold onto the pen he is betting with. But as soon as he figures out which number he wants to bet on, he holds on to the pen with directness and determination. </p>
            <p> So if you are working a scene for an audition or for filming, ask yourself:  Are you holding a prop in this scene? How do the stakes of your scene impact how you handle that prop?</p>
            <p> And to develop that even further, take a look at how Lee Jung-jae holds on to his ticket, versus how he holds onto the racehorse catalog. Two different props, one with the potential to life-changing abilities, the other not as important and used to channel his stress. </p>
            <span><em> <b>SEE CLIP HERE: </b><a target="__blank" href="https://youtu.be/uVqSk9sfVN0">https://youtu.be/uVqSk9sfVN0 </a></em></span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> Gae-Yeong's Birthday Dinner</h2>
            <p><em> 13:30 minutes in: </em></p>
            <p> Seon Gi-Hun  takes his daughter Gae-yeong (played by Reagan To) out for her birthday. But having lost his winnings, he has to buy her fast food. They always say never act with children or animals, because they will always steal the show, due to their ability to be completely authentic. In this case, it’s absolutely true. The way Reagan To displays her emotions so subtly in this scene is incredible. The entire scene is very memorable, however, two moments that stand out are when she receives the gun lighter as a gift and when she makes the decision not to tell her father she’s moving to the US. </p>
            <p> Gae-young swings between disbelief and false excitement, while she holds up the lighter that is shaped like a gun. Most of those swings are in her eyes, and very still demeanor, as she gazes at the gift and back at her father. The lesson to take from this moment is that, as actors, we sometimes tend to focus on one emotion when we do a scene. However, life is more complex than that. We can feel a variety of emotions all at once, and a way to tackle a scene is to find the different layers of a situation and understand the different emotions that could be present. </p>
            <p> Seon Gi-Hun makes a promise to his daughter that “next year” he will quit smoking for her birthday. Gae-young’s face falls, and asks, “next year?” because, what her father doesn’t know, is that her stepfather is moving them to the United States. When we watch this for the first time in the pilot, we don’t know this - we find out after, however, when you look back at the scene, with that knowledge, it is incredibly clear.  Gae-young has a brief moment where she thinks about whether or not she should tell her father and then decides not to. As actors, we often forget about the “moment of decision”, we do this every day, and it’s an intricate detail that can add immense depth to your scenes. </p>
            <span><em> <b>SEE CLIP HERE: </b><a  target="__blank" href="https://youtu.be/q3xn2Eb7ERo">https://youtu.be/q3xn2Eb7ERo </a></em></span>

        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Oh Mal Talks About Her Granddaughter Leaving</h2>
            <p><em> 26:11 minutes in:  </em></p>
            <p> Oh-Mal Soon, (played by Kim Young-ok) 456’s mother, knows that her granddaughter is moving to the United States. It is established earlier in the episode that her granddaughter is one of the most important people in her life, particularly because her son is a thief and gambler.  In this scene, Oh Mal-Soon tells her son the news and begs him to get his life together to stop them from leaving.</p>
            <p> What is extremely powerful in this scene is the stillness by Lee Jung-jae and the tactics by Kim Young-ok. The guilt and defeat that 456 has throughout this scene is a direct obstacle for Oh Mal- Soon and it’s evident in her consistent change in tactics throughout the scene. She starts off, defeated and reserved, moves her way to anger, then pleading and then guilt, and sadness, all while reflecting that in her eyes. </p>
            <p> A huge thing to implement in your auditions, or scenes is a diverse change in tactics. It’s incredibly human to try every tactic to get what we want - the more tactics we use, the more we want the thing we are asking for.  </p>
            <span><em> <b>SEE CLIP HERE: </b><a  target="__blank" href="https://youtu.be/8ITHVOxsjk4?t=587 ">https://youtu.be/8ITHVOxsjk4?t=587  </a></em></span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFour"> The Fight Between Kang Sae-Byeok and Jang Deok-Su</h2>
            <p><em> 34:08 minutes in:  </em></p>
            <p> We are introduced to 067 and 101 (played by Hoyeon and Heo Sung-tae) by a domestic fight between them. The character’s personalities become incredibly clear within this short scene. </p>
            <p> Both actors, despite being involved in a physical fight, are still and calculated with their movements. 067 stares at 101, without a word as he talks down to her. This stillness with prolonged eye contact displays confidence, despite her having just been beaten up. On the other side of the coin, 101 is nonchalant and laughing at her, which in this current circumstance displays his lack of empathy and violent persona. </p>
            <p> Though there is a power play between the two characters, their eyes show their entire history. We can see the pain that Jang Deok-su has caused Kan Sae-byeok, he clearly has abused her and the hate, fear, and pain in her posture are contrasted with the defiance in her eyes. Another example of feeling many emotions all at once. </p>
            <p> There are many things to take away from this scene. Firstly, villains never think they are evil. 101 believes he is in the right for beating up 067, and additionally, he enjoys it. One thing many green actors do when playing a “bad guy” is putting on a bad guy persona when really, the scarier thing to do is care very little, and play the scene as casually as possible. It is much scarier to see someone act like violence is a common thing in their life, with little remorse than someone who is making a show of it. </p>
            <p> The second thing to take away from this scene is that the physicality of one’s body can tell a whole story. Professional actors take on a character from head to toe - from the way they hold themselves, to the way they move. Take a second to see what body movements 101 and 067 do throughout the scene and how they drastically change depending on what’s occurring, who is speaking to them, and how they feel. </p>
            <span><em> <b>SEE CLIP HERE: </b><a  target="__blank" href="https://youtu.be/BKAvPZZ3EkU ">https://youtu.be/BKAvPZZ3EkU  </a></em></span>

        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFive"> Red Light Green Light Deaths</h2>
            <p><em> 48:11 minutes in:  </em></p>
            <p> The first mass murder scene. This scene is an amalgamation of intensity, stunning screenwriting, and great acting. There are many lessons one can learn from this scene. 
            Putting aside the blood and sweat that is all makeup and special effects, the real effects that make this scene so powerful is the intensity in the actors' eyes. 
            </p>
            <p> Mass murder has just happened while playing red light green light, and 456 is stuck under a dead man. He has only a certain amount of time to get to the finish line before the huge female robot eliminates all the remaining players.  As 456 watches people around him being killed, his fear becomes a visceral body shake, and his thoughts are going a mile a minute. An incredible tip to showing immense fear is that physical element of your body going into shock. This choice is a powerful one, particularly in this scene where he has to remain still, and as such his body would likely shake even more! A great example of objective (to stay still to survive) and obstacle (people are dying around you and your body is in shock). </p>
            <p> Another great tip for showing fear is quick eye shifts. As 456 lies there surrounded by people being shot dead, we see his eyes quickly shifting. He is not only trying to take in everything that is happening around him but also he needs to make certain choices to survive. </p>
            <p> As the scene progresses, however, we see how different characters' eye movements tell different stories. When 218 is talking to 456, his eyes are still. He is determined to watch the danger in front of him, and only really changes his gaze toward 456 when he is referring to him. 456’s eye movements change from fear and confusion to determination once he talks to 218 and he decides to survive the game. </p>
            <p> Another wonderful storytelling moment that comes from the actor's eyes in this scene is the small back and forth-between 067 and 101. 101 is seen to be determined to survive, as he stays as still as possible, while also flinching each time someone is shot. Suddenly, however, his eyes begin to shift uncontrollably as he realizes 067 is behind him and could push him over at any moment. 101 goes from determined to vulnerable in a matter of milliseconds as his eyes reveal his feelings. </p>
            <p> The final moment I will touch on is 001’s childlike demeanor as he plays the game. How a person acts at any given moment reveals a lot about their character. At first glance, we assume that 001 has a form of dementia and is unaffected by the mass murder around him. However, upon rewatching the episode, we know the real reason he is elated by this game and what is going on around him. Great writing and great acting go hand in hand here, it is a cherry on top, if when watching something for a second time, we can still tie the twists and turns but from a different perspective. </p>
            <p> I urge you to watch this clip several times and find all the eye-revealing moments because I have only touched on a few. </p>

    <p> 7 Tips on how to Handle Auditions Nerves </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionOne"> Breathe</h2>
            <p> I am sure you have heard this time and time again. The reason it is such a repeated tip is that it really works. For those who claim it doesn’t, it’s likely they aren’t doing it correctly. </p>
            <p> Yes, I am telling you there is a way to breathe correctly, and most of us don’t know how to do it. But it takes a while to understand and implement these techniques. So, in the meantime, here is a way to implement breathing instantly to calm you down. </p>
            <p> 
            <ul><em>
            <li>Release all the air from your lungs, until you can no longer exhale. </li>
            <li>Hold for as long as you can</li>
            <li>And then let your body take in the breath it needs to. </li>
            </em></ul>
            </p>
            <p> This allows you to take a natural breath without overthinking it. Many times when people are told to breathe in order to relax, they overthink it and end up hyperventilating. So the best way to avoid that is to let it all out, and take an authentic breath in. </p>
            <p> This exercise is great to do before your audition, and then right before you go into the room. Make sure to ground your feet and close your eyes while you do it, so you can really ground yourself and focus on your breath. </p>
            <p> If you want a more in-depth look at breathing exercises take a look at <a href="/5-breathing-exercises-for-actors">5 BREATHING EXERCISES FOR ACTORS</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> Be Prepared</h2>
            <p> When you really boil it down, there are two things that you want to go into an audition room with: confidence and calm. Being prepared feeds both. </p>
            <p> Being prepared means you have worked your audition, and spent time understanding the character, the project, and everything around that. This is sometimes mistaken for “amount of time” working on, but really it’s the intensity and depth, more than the time spent doing the homework. </p>
            <p> For some actors, this means knowing their lines extremely well, so they can focus on the nuances, for others, it means understanding the character in-depth and implementing the lines after. You need to find what it is for you, but regardless, you need to feel as if you put in the work that was required to do well at the audition. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Playlists</h2>
            <p> Video and audio playlists can be a saving grace before an audition! Not only are they easily accessible through your phone, but they can also be a happy distraction or focus tool. </p>
            <p><strong> Audio Playlists:</strong></p>
            <p> You can use music in whatever way you like, however, what I find personally helpful is creating a playlist for the specific character I am going in for. The reason for this is that various playlists invoke different moods, and if that mood doesn’t feed into your audition, you could end up going in with the wrong energy. </p>
            <p> For example, if you have a meditation playlist that calms you, it could be helpful, in grounding you and putting you in a zen place - but what if the character you're auditioning for has neurotic and frantic energy? You could go into your audition zen and calm, instead of using the intensity of your nerves and focusing them with a character-specific playlist! </p>
            <p> Character-specific playlists are entirely up to you. It really is about finding music that puts you in the headspace of the character. The real treat about doing this is if you get a callback for the role, you can go right back to the playlist and instantly channel what you did for the original audition. </p>
            <p><strong> Video playlists </strong></p>
            <p> Just like audio playlists, you can find certain actors or scenes that bring out the mood and traits that will help you internalize your character. Youtube allows you to make private playlists, which you can name and keep on your account. </p>
            <p> The other perk of video playlists is you can create ones that simply make you feel good. Perhaps your favorite movie or scenes with your favorite actor remind you why you are pursuing this craft. Feeling good at an audition can have incredible results! </p>
            <p> Just remember when listening or watching prior to an audition that you also have one ear/eye open for when it is your turn. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFour"> Focus on Your Reader</h2>
            <p> The various ups and downs of audition nerves are endless. Sometimes you can be calm before entering your audition and then once you have entered the room, you feel them boiling up. A great way to focus them is to simply look at the person who is your reader, or scene partner. </p>
            <p> Just take a second to look at their eyes, their wardrobe, or their hair. Something specific of your choice, and take it in. This will bring you to the present, and your nerves will subside or be focused. </p>
            <p> If you can’t focus on what you are seeing, then focus on the words they are saying. If you can take the time to hear what they are saying to you, you will initiate your listening skills, and listening is compelling and it is also focused.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFive"> Shift Your Mindset</h2>
            <p> Audition nerves will never fully go away, in fact, you don’t want them to. As I mentioned above, audition nerves are an indication that you care about your craft. As such, why not see them that way? </p>
            <p> There was a study done at Harvard, where they noticed that those struggling with nerves found it extremely difficult to calm down, but found it quite easy to shift their mindset on what they were feeling. This is because excitement and nervousness do similar things to the body.</p>
            <p> If you can tell yourself, <em>I am excited,  I GET to audition versus  I am nervous - I HAVE to audition</em>, your mind begins to interpret those feelings as such. In this situation, it really is mind over matter. Part of rewiring this way of thinking is catching your thoughts as they happen and reminding yourself that you are in fact excited, not nervous.</p>
            <p> This is where our next point comes into play. 

        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionSix"> Mantra</h2>
            <p> Mantras have become something people seem to cringe at these days. Part of the reason for this is they are used offhandedly without any belief or active thought. People also often impose their mantras on others, which doesn’t work.  In order for a mantra to work it needs to be personal to you and invoke a deep feeling. </p>
            <p> If you don’t know where to start, you can always start with something generic like:</p>
            <ul><em>
                <li>“I am worthy”</li>
                <li>“I am excited” </li>
                <li>“I am prepared and confident” </li>
            </em></ul>
            <p> Once you’ve started to implement a mantra into your day-to-day, you can start experimenting with sentences that are more personal to you.</p>
            <p> <strong>STORYTIME: </strong></p>
            <p> Many years ago, when I had my first booking, the first song to come on my shuffle after I got the call was Rufus Wainwright's Hallelujah. I remember feeling so proud of myself, feeling like things were actually happening for me, and so the next audition I had, I told myself “Hallelujah” which reminded me how capable I am. This is what I mean by making it personal. If I told someone else to tell themselves “Hallelujah” as a mantra, it would do nothing for them, because they don’t have the feelings of success and accomplishment that went with it. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionSeven"> Train</h2>
            <p> This really should be The Messy Actor mantra - Train Train Train. 
            The reason training is on this list is that when you train, you begin to understand the craft better, and the more you do it, the more confident you will become. 
            </p>
            <p> Let me make a point that, if training doesn’t give you confidence and doesn’t make you feel good, then you probably want to change who you are training with. Training should make you more confident and make you feel you know what you are doing at least a little bit. Of course, with learning, there are definite growing pains, so you may not feel good all the time, however, you should feel like training, at least give you a good foundation to go into an audition.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="summary-li">
        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>You likely will not be able to put all seven of these tips to work prior to an audition but take the time to go over them and see which ones work for you. As you begin implementing these tips as habits, you can start to incorporate more and more of them into your practice. Remember: these aren’t going to fix your nerves, nor are they going to subside them right away. With time and repetition, you will find that your confidence and calm going into auditions will grow. </p>

                    <p> Rerouting negative thought patterns will help with your craft when you need to remove yourself from a dark character or a character that lives in a negative world. A professor of mine once told me, that the craft is not only getting into the mind of a character, it’s getting out. If you are on set, and you are playing a character who has dark troubles, or perhaps evil tendencies, when CUT is called, it would be in your best interest to be able to separate yourself from the work.  </p>
                    <p> On a personal level, this industry can be a hard one. Whether it be outside critiques or inner ones, being able to handle them, and mold them into something positive will be very helpful. Especially if you are on set, and you need to be focusing on your work and not on a thought that has the ability to derail you.  </p>
                    <p> Below are SIX tips for you to get started on your rerouting negative thought journey. Keep in mind, that this is not something that happens overnight, this is a habit to curate. Therefore, start now, and actively do it for a month to make it into a habit!  </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionOne"> Identify the Thought</h2>
            <p> One of the reasons that negative thoughts get the best of us is that we believe that everything we think must be true. However, in a lot of scenarios our mind, depending on the mood we are in, is feeding us lies! Whenever you have a negative thought, be it about someone else or yourself, take note of it. </p>
            <p> In the beginning, you may have to make an active effort in doing this. So instead of making a note mentally, put that note into action. You can say it aloud, “NEGATIVE THOUGHT”, you can pinch the skin between your index and thumb, you can pull out a sticky note and place it on a table or desk, or my personal favorite: take a washable marker and put a dot on your hand. The idea is you want to be able to see just how many times you had a negative thought in your day. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> Challenge the Thought</h2>
            <p> The next step is to challenge that thought. This is the beginning of transforming the thought from something harmful to something neutral, and hopefully something positive. The best way to challenge the thought is to ask this simple three-word question: <b>IS THAT TRUE?</b> </p>
            <p> It may be strange to ask this at first because your brain will want to say: yes it is. But instead of allowing that, challenge your brain by answering why it couldn’t possibly be true. Find every single reason why this thought couldn’t possibly be true. 
            </p>
            <p> The next question to ask yourself is <b>WHY DO I WANT THIS TO BE TRUE?</b> This one was always the trippiest for me to answer because I would find that dwelling in negative thoughts was actually something my body relished in since it was a comfortable place to be. As an actor it is integral you get to a place where you can look at yourself for who you are authentically, so answering this question honestly will help you a lot in the long run.</p>
            <p> The final question you can ask is: <B>WOULD I EVER SAY THIS TO SOMEONE ELSE?</b> Why or why not? And additionally, <b>WHAT WOULD I SAY TO SOMEONE IF THEY SAID THIS ABOUT THEMSELVES?</b> We often think worst things about ourselves than we do other people, and very often if someone comes to us with a similar thought we remind them how untrue it is. It’s important that you can do that for yourself too, particularly in this industry that is full of rejection. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Replace the Thought</h2>
            <p> Once you have answered these questions, it is time to either neutralize the thought or spin it to make it positive. It is important to take note that you are never stopping the thought. Stopping negative thoughts allows them to resurface doubly charged - you are simply rerouting their path.</p>
            <p> Replacing the thought can be as simple as changing the wording. For example A common saying for actors is “I have to audition” which actually has a negative connotation to it. To replace this thought and make it positive, you’d change it to I get to audition. Another way of replacing the thought is coming to the conclusion that the original thought was in fact wrong, and you change it entirely. </p>
            <p> For example: <em>I am a bad actor</em> would become <em>I am talented</em>.  In order to replace this, you would have found all the reasons why you are in fact a great actor, which dissolves the argument that you are bad. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFour"> Journal Uncensored</h2>
            <p> Sometimes all you need to move past a negative thought is to get it out. Our minds are always flooded with so much information, and one of the reasons negative thoughts can build over time is that they aren’t being expressed. However, not all thoughts are worth expressing to a person, as they could be hurtful, or burn a bridge, but they still deserve to be out of your mind. A great way to do this is to get a journal. </p>
            <p> Personally, I find that writing by hand is a much more effective way of getting out thoughts, but for some that can be tedious or even too slow for the number of thoughts they have in their mind. You can try doing an audio journal, video journal, or even an app journal. Whatever the method, find a place where you can write or speak uncensored and without any judgment. </p>
            <p> I personally never go back and read what I have written, that is not its purpose. The purpose is to get the thoughts out and then move on with your day. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFive"> Practice Mindfulness and Gratitude</h2>
            <p> Another way to ease negative thoughts is to practice meditation, mindfulness, or gratitude.  The way you practice these is completely up to you. </p>
            <p> This can be finding a mantra (as discussed in <a href="/7-tips-on-how-to-handle-audition-nerves"target="__blank">7 TIPS ON HOW TO HANDLE AUDITION NERVES</a>) or making a list of all the things you are grateful for in your career. If you are religious or spiritual it could be praying, or even something as simple as putting in time for meditation. Whatever you choose, this should be a time when you can find stillness and grounding in your day-to-day. </p>
            <p> There is a tendency when starting to work with negative thoughts to roll one's eyes at these methods. It’s a way your brain has wired itself to resist change. Acknowledge those thoughts, but try it anyway. Gratitude is not only something that helps us personally, it resonates outward to our colleagues and experiences as well. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionSix"> Find a Community of Positive People</h2>
            <p> Jim Rohn is known to have said “we are the average of the 5 people we spend the most time with.” Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler are known to have done research to prove that in fact, you are the average of the 5 people's friends that you spend time with. Meaning: if you surround yourself with positive people, who are also influenced by positive people, you are more likely to be positive. </p>
            <p> So yes, you should be surrounding yourself with actors who are still excited and keen on the craft. People who train, want to grow and find joy in the work. However, these people should also be people that you can go to, to help lift you up. </p>
            <p> As actors, it is important that we have a community of people with who we can talk honestly about the tribulations of the industry. There is a lot of competition and desire to show that “we are succeeding” which doesn’t provide a safe space for negative experiences. There is a lot of doubt, rejection, and pain that comes with this job as well, and having a safe space to be heard, and reassured is just as important. </p>
            <p> Keep an eye out for people who hear your pains and doubts, understand them, and then lift you up. These are the people you want in your circle. They don’t necessarily need to be actors - they can be creators, producers, writers, and artists - it doesn’t matter what they do in the industry, it matters that they hear you, and you hear them from a place of understanding. </p>
            <p> Online communities are also quite popular nowadays, you can join various twitch, Reddit, or Facebook groups, as well as you are now a part of our safe community here at The Messy Actor, so please come by our Instagram page (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/themessyactorblog/" target="__blank">themessyactor</a>) and introduce yourself! </p>

        <p>Breaking out of negative thinking patterns will greatly improve your career and your life. Take the time every day to start making a habit of molding your thinking patterns. Your future self will thank you. Remember, not being negative doesn’t mean you need to be excessively positive. Finding neutral ground where thoughts are objective and factual as opposed to hurtful or elated can add a sense of calm to your acting practice and career. </p>

    <p> Breathing is one of the fundamentals of acting. It allows you to ground yourself and be present. Now, you may be saying to yourself: I am breathing, otherwise, I’d be dead. Yes, valid, but you are likely taking very shallow breaths. This lack of proper breathing depth may make you stressed, allow you to forget lines, and even rush your audition.   </p>
    <p> There is a myriad of reasons why breathing exercises are incredibly helpful to your craft, but one of the greatest things about them - you can do them in the audition room (virtual or otherwise). Since they are silent, you don’t have to worry about calling attention to yourself while you are waiting to go into the room.  </p>
    <p> Below are FIVE breathing exercises you can do while you wait.  </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionOne"> THE COUNTING CYCLE</h2>
            <p> This exercise has multiple variations depending on what numbers you pick. The idea however is that you inhale on a count, hold your breath for a count and exhale on a count and hold for a count. </p>
            <p> <b>The Box count: </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> INHALE 4</li>
                <li> HOLD 4</li>
                <li>  EXHALE 4</li>
                <li> HOLD 4</li>
            </ul>
            <p> <b>The Hour Glass count: </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> INHALE 8 </li>
                <li> HOLD 4</li>
                <li>  EXHALE 8 </li>
                <li> HOLD 4 </li>
            </ul>
         <b>The Vase count: </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> INHALE for 8 </li>
                <li> HOLD for 2 </li>
                <li>  EXHALE for 4</li>
                <li> HOLD for 2 </li>
            </ul>
            <p> 
            You can select any variation that works for you, but keep in mind that the longer your inhales and exhales, the deeper an experience you will get. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> EMPTYING YOUR LUNGS</h2>
            <p> This exercise is all about emptying your lungs so that you can fill them entirely</p>
            <p> <b>How you do this is as follows:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> INHALE a normal breath</li>
                <li> EXHALE until you can no longer exhale</li>
                <li>  HOLD for as long as you can</li>
                <li> Let your body do what it wants to naturally. It will inhale, but it’s instinctual as you will be completely out of breath. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When your body’s breathing instinct kicks in it helps regulate your breathing, but it also allows you to get a deeper breath than any forced inhale would. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionThree"> PANTING </h2>
            <p> Panting may be a strange thing to tell you to do in public, but this is deliberate panting that isn’t on voice. This exercise not only gets your breathing going, but also warms up your vocal cords. 
            </p>
            <p> <b>What you want to do is the following:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Drop your jaw, naturally, so that your mouth is open</li>
                <li> Start panting in voiceless 5-pant increments, aiming more for a HAW sound (if you were to make a sound) rather than a HA sound. </li>
                <li>  Repeat 5 times</li>
                <li> Take a small break & repeat. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFour"> ALTERNATING NOSTRILS</h2>
            <p> This exercise is exactly what the title suggests. You will be breathing out of one nostril, and then the other. It’s also known as the “straw” exercise, but I find this to be much better for you, as the straw can be strenuous</p>
            <p> <b>In order to do this exercise:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Plug one of your nostrils with your index finger </li>
                <li> INHALE on an 8 count through that nostril</li>
                <li>  HOLD on to a natural cycle, whatever is normal for your breathing pattern (usually a 1) </li>
                <li> EXHALE on an 8 count through that nostril</li>
                <li> Switch nostrils</li>
                <li> Repeat the exercise, but this time, exhale through your mouth. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> This focuses your body on the airflow going in and out, which has a calming and grounding effect. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFive"> YAWNING </h2>
            <p> This exercise is just manifesting fake yawns until you yawn for real. The idea is to get the deepest, and longest yawn you can. Beware though, yawning is contagious, and you could put yourself in a yawning cycle. You only want to do about 3-5 yawns in total. </p>
        </li>
        
        <li class="summary-li">
        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>As mentioned above, all these exercises can be done in the audition waiting room. I know many people who do them with their eyes closed, so they don’t get distracted in case someone looks their way. Now that you know these exercises, you can do them however often you like. </p>
        <p>I would also suggest going to our Instagram page and saving the post about it, so you can refer to it when you are sitting in the audition room.</p>

    <p> Every actor is different, and the methods of crying on demand may differ from person to person. However here are four answers to the question: How do actors cry?  </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionOne"> TRANSFERENCE & SUBSTITUTION</h2>
            <p> Transference and substitution are acting methods that were coined by one of the great acting teachers: Uta Hagen. She believed that the actor could take moments and experiences from their life, and transfer them over into the scene they were exploring. </p>
            <p> This would mean recalling back to a moment in one's life where one felt the same emotion that the character they are portraying was feeling, and exploring it within the scene. </p>
            <p> When it comes to tears, recalling a moment when you were sad, or happy (to a point of tears) can bring back those sentiments and begin the waterworks. </p>
            <p> <b>Ex: Your character has lost a parent. </b></p>
            <p> Perhaps you don’t know what it’s like to lose a parent, but maybe you have lost a pet or experienced heartbreak that can put you in a place of sadness, which can then be imported into your scene about losing a parent. The more specific you are, the more nuanced that sadness can be. Remember, sadness can incorporate happiness, anger, regret…etc. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> IMAGINING THE SITUATION</h2>
            <p> For some, recalling moments in their life when they were sad, can in fact put up blocks. Perhaps your mind and body don’t want to remember those moments, that is something you want to keep to yourself, and in the past. That is perfectly okay, it is up to you to figure out what methods of exploring your emotions are best for you. </p>
            <p> Another method actors use is their imagination. Some people have very vivid imaginations and they can place themselves in the situation their character is in, which will allow them to have a visceral emotional reaction just by imagining. </p>
            <p> <b>Ex: Your character has lost a parent. </b></p>
            <p> All it takes for this method is for you to imagine you have in fact lost a parent, and how that would make you feel. The danger of this method is the relationship with your parent, may be different than that of the character, so be sure that what you are exploring emotionally correlates to your scene. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionThree"> CONNECTING WITH YOUR SCENE PARTNER</h2>
            <p> Human connection is one of the most wonderful things in our industry. It’s also one of your best tools as an actor and another method that actors use to cry in a scene. If you have a scene partner, using their emotions to fuel you is a great way to get the waterworks going. </p>
            <p> <b>Ex: Your character has lost a parent. </b></p>
            <p> Perhaps you are talking to your scene partner about your parent. If you can make eye contact with your scene partner, and see how they are feeling about the situation, that will naturally start to make you feel certain things. If you can see empathy, sympathy, pain etc, in their eyes this can begin to fuel your own emotions. </p>
            <p> Don’t believe me? Think of all the moments when you were watching a movie or talking to someone who was going through something painful, and they began to cry - very likely you also had the urge to cry too. This idea is the same one applied here but to your scene partner. </p>
            <p> I am willing to bet this is most actors' favorite way to get emotional because you get to do it with someone else, however, beware, there are situations where you won’t have a scene partner, and you will have to get to the same emotional place, with or without one. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFour"> TRICKING YOUR BODY</h2>
            <p> Sometimes the imagination and the emotional work don’t work. It may be that it’s been a very long emotional day, or perhaps the image that was working stops (this can happen). One of the great things about our bodies is we can trick them if we know how. </p>
            <p> A simple example would be a yawn or a laugh. If you fake a yawn or force a laugh, eventually you will get an authentic one. The same goes for tears. </p>
            <p> If you scrunch up your face, like you are going to cry, very often, if your instrument is open to releasing the emotion, you can trick your body into releasing tears, snot, and even phlegm at the back of your throat which is what occurs during crying. </p>
            <p> I would use this as a last resort. The reason is, <em>tears are not the be-all-end-all when it comes to emotional scenes</em>. They are the cherry on top, but they do not dictate whether you are a good actor. Better to have a scene being emotionally dialed in than have forced tears that are inauthentic. </p>
            <p> If the producers or director want you to have tears, and they aren’t flowing (for whatever reason) they can get makeup to give you some eye drops to really sell the point home. </p>
        </li>

        <li class="summary-li">
        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>So though it is impressive and a useful tool for an actor to be able to cry on demand, it is not essential to a scene. Tears can signify a myriad of things, and they are not a factor to determine whether you are a good or bad actor. If you are an actor and are worried about your inability to produce tears, you may need to explore why you can’t access those emotions. Very often it has little to do with your acting abilities, and more to do with your day-to-day life, and what emotions you allow yourself day to day. </p>
        <p> <em>TIP: Allow yourself to feel every emotion, without blocking, particularly when watching movies/TV.</em> </p>
        <p>  If you feel the urge to tear up during a movie, allow it. This will help you tenfold in your career.  </p>

    <p> Ready or not, I had to dive in and swim! I learned a lot along the way and I’d like to share that with you, in the hopes that when you book your first #1, you feel ready to go!  </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionOne"> Get To Know The Script Intimately </h2>
            <p> When filming a feature film, you will never film the scenes in order. (In fact, for this particular one, we shot the “bad guy reveal” on Day 1 of 13.) For this reason, it is essential that you know the script intimately. This means knowing the order of what happens and when. </p>
            <p> Knowing this information will then indicate to you what your emotional state is within every scene. As a lead, your character is likely to have an arc from the beginning of the film to the end. This means, your character will be changing and evolving as the film progresses. Due to this, it’s important you know where that is in the script. That way, when you film part of Scene 2 on Day 1 and then again on Day 10, you know what energy and emotional state to bring to the scene. </p>
            <p> Another thing that happens quite often while shooting a film, is that the shooting schedule will change on a whim. You may wake up prepared to shoot Scene 10, but suddenly something could happen, like a change in weather, and just like that, you are filming Scene 23. If you haven’t gotten to know your script inside and out, you may not be prepared to shoot that scene. But guess what? You will have to anyway. </p>
            <p> You don’t necessarily need to know the entire script by heart, but you do need to be familiar enough with it, that if the scenes of the day change, you are able to jump in and shoot the scene. </p>
            <p> There will likely be areas in the script that are more emotionally demanding than others. I would highly recommend putting time into exploring the emotions and thoughts behind those scenes. Make no mistake, however, you aren’t planning how you are going to act out every moment, you still need to be present and malleable enough to be directed, you are simply exploring what the possibilities of those scenes could be. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> Overprepare</h2>
            <p> This point is pretty self-explanatory, prepare so much that most of your preparation isn’t used. 
            In this particular film, I played a pianist. However, that wasn’t particularly important to the plot of the film.  It was important however to how my character carried herself, how she interacted with a piano and how she played piano. There were two moments in the film where Sloane had to play piano, and just in case, I learned the pieces that were mentioned in the script. 
            </p>
            <p> It turned out that I played to a pre-recorded track, and I didn’t need to learn them, but learning them gave me a lot to work with. I knew the rhythm of the song, which allowed me to mime it better, and my hope, make it look more believable. </p>
            <p> Another thing that I prepped for, that never would have occurred to me, if it hadn’t happened to me directly, was physical preparation. Let me explain. Two days prior to hearing I booked the part, I sprained my ankle terribly. I was on crutches, and couldn’t walk.  I then got the call, read the script, and realized… I have to run. A LOT.   </p>
            <p> The next day, I booked a physio appointment and told him, I need to be in great working condition in two weeks - is that possible? He said, yes. So I got to work doing exercises and stretches and working out in ways that would help my mobility.  When shoot day came, I was ready to run up staircases, and climb through windows. And not to toot my own horn, but I don’t think it was at all noticeable! **</p>
            <p> Now this sprained ankle story may not come in useful to you in some respects. I mean how often are you going to sprain your ankle before you book a lead role? But the point I am trying to make is: if you read the script, and you are doing something physical which is beyond something you do in your day-to-day routine. Put the work in to get yourself in a place where your body and mind are ready to go. It may not come in useful on shoot day, as you may have a stunt double, but it will put you in a position of understanding and focus for your role. </p>
            <p> <i>** I took care of my ankle all throughout the shoot as well. Lots of icepacks and stretches while I wasn’t shooting too.</i></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Connect with your fellow castmates</h2>
            <p> One of the greatest luxuries I had prior to shooting this film was that my agent represented both myself and Brett Geddes, who played David (#2) in the film. Our agent suggested that we meet prior to filming. We spoke daily until we met in person, on the first day of filming. </p>
            <p> I hadn’t realized just how important this would be on set.</p>
            <p> I was able to curate a close relationship with Brett, that given the circumstances of the film, helped me quite a bit. He was my younger brother in the film, someone I cared for deeply and had a strong connection with. The connection in real life and the connection in the film became synonymous while the cameras were rolling. I often found myself connecting to Brett during emotional scenes, which allowed me to be present and listen. He was my rock and pillar during those three weeks of filming. I give him a lot of credit for my performance (he naturally won’t take it, but it’s there on my end).</p>
            <p> Now, we can’t always be that lucky. Not every castmate will be Brett Geddes, however, you can try and connect with your fellow castmates in order to get to know who you will be working with. 
            You can either ask your agent to follow up with production to see if your castmate will be willing, or reach out to them on social media. Or even wait until the first day of shooting and see who you naturally connect with. 
            </p>
            <p> Filming a movie can be a very intimate ordeal, it’s important you feel you have someone who’s got your back, even just for the time you’re shooting. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFour"> Be respectful and kind </h2>
            <p> I personally find this to be a redundant point, I feel it shouldn’t have to be said, but unfortunately, I have heard horror stories of #1s making set a living nightmare. So - this point still needs to be made.</p>
            <p> As a #1, you do have a certain responsibility to create the mood of the set. You are by no means the most important person on set, do not get me wrong. However, there are a lot of eyes on you and how you act will determine how everyone else feels about the project. You are, after all, the face of the project. </p>
            <p> This means, respecting and being kind to everyone on set. The crew, the admin, your fellow actors - EVERYONE.  Everyone is there to do their job, and if you can make people feel happy at work, then I truly feel the project will be better for it. Creativity thrives in a nurtured environment. </p>
            <p> Just like in every job, there can be frustrations, and things that go wrong. How you handle these situations is also important. Handling situations with grace, maturity, and level-headedness goes a long way. </p>
            <p> I do realize that as a #1 you have a lot to do, but do not forget that for everything you are doing, the crew is working longer and harder to make you look good. Compassion and gratitude for them will make your time on set a better one, for them and for you. </p>
            <p> On a personal note, I never understood actors who didn’t speak to the crew. I personally think that segregation between talent and crew is ridiculous, and as a #1 you can absolutely remove that precedent. But that’s just me! </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFive"> Remember people's names</h2>
            <p> This is a simple one that goes a long way. We all know that feeling when you have been working with someone for a week, and you know their name, and they make it known that they don’t know yours - it’s not a great feeling. You can go above and beyond by showing everyone you work with that they are important, and a small way of doing this is by remembering their names. </p>
            <p> I realize that there can be dozens, if not a hundred people around you at one time, as a #1. This is why I recommend keeping your call sheet close by. If you meet someone, say they are a grip, find their name on your call sheet and write down a small note of your interaction. If you do happen to forget their name, at least you know you can go back to your call sheet to recall it. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionSix"> Express your boundaries and needs</h2>
            <p> Though this is something I have difficulty doing in my day-to-day life, it is an important part of being a #1 on set. It’s also a balancing act. Finding the right moment to express your needs and boundaries is essential. </p>
            <p> <b>For example:</b> You don’t feel comfortable in your wardrobe</p>
            <p> For the purpose of this example, let’s say you are doing a scene that requires a bathing suit. Wardrobe has picked a bikini (or speedo) that reveals more of you than you anticipated. </p>
            <p> The right time to express your boundaries is during the fitting. You can express your discomfort, or perhaps a solution you would be more comfortable with. The incorrect time to express this would be halfway through the shoot when you have already shot several scenes with it on.
            Perhaps this example is a bit on the nose, but its purpose is to show you that there is a right and wrong time to express your needs. 
            </p>
            <p> When it comes to boundaries, this becomes a little more complex. I would never usually tell anyone to stop a take, however when it comes to boundaries with safety or security, stopping a take can be as big as a matter of life and death. 
            </p>
            <p> In the case of <em>Fatal Family Reunion</em>, I had to throw stunts woman Alyssa Pellerin Boudreau off a balcony. Stunt Coordinator Steve Kelsall went over the choreography with both of us several times, with the instructions that should something not feel safe, we stop the take. Better to stop the take, than have someone get injured. What was wonderful about this stunts team is that they checked in with me on my comfort and boundaries every step of the way. When asked, “is there anything you feel we should know, or you feel uncomfortable about?” I said, “ I do have a sprained ankle if we can do choreography that doesn’t aggravate it, that would be wonderful”. I expressed my boundary, and it was acknowledged and then I knew they had my best interest in mind. We had a killer fight scene, and my ankle didn’t feel a thing! 
            </p>
            <p> Additionally, when it comes to intimacy in a scene it’s important you vocalize your boundaries, and concerns either with an intimacy coordinator if they are on set, or with your scene partner and director. Nck Name and I had to share a few kisses during filming, and several discussions and covid precautions were taken before every kiss. These sorts of things, though small, make a big difference.
            </p>
            <p> Finally, staying true to your personal boundaries outside of acting is incredibly important. If an actor or crew member crosses one of your boundaries, talking to them privately or mentioning it to an AD is crucial to make sure your time on set going forward is a happy one. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionSeven"> Shut down your doubts</h2>
            <p> This was my biggest takeaway from shooting <em>Fatal Family Reunion</em>. Do not let your insecurities get the best of you. When hired for a lead, a lot of feelings can arise, for me in particular I had a lot of imposter syndrome. I felt like I had no idea what I was doing. </p>
            <p> I remember DAY 2 rolled around and I realized that if I was going to give my all to this film, I had no room for all the terrible things my inner critic was telling me. I actually managed to subdue those feelings for most of the shoot until the second last day of shooting. </p>
            <p> We were out in public, we’d blocked off a very busy part of the downtown core, and people were watching, taking pictures and there was a lot happening. All of a sudden, my inner critic was LOUD. I remember looking over to Li Dong, the director of the film, and feeling like I couldn’t for the life of me give him what he needed at that moment. 
            </p>
            <p> Li is an exceptional director, he read me like a book, before the take he subtly handed me a piece of paper and on it, it said “You are Incredible.” It was what I needed at that moment to remind me that my inner critics were wrong, HOWEVER, <em>he shouldn’t have had to do that for me</em>. 
            </p>
            <p> I know that as a professional actor this craft is not my identity, it is my job, and as such I do not require external validation from anyone to do my work. Li’s note reminded me that I am talented, and I will do my darndest to not bring my insecurities to set. The reason is, all of these people - producers, directors, network associates, hired you for a reason, they believe you can do it. So who are you to question them?  </p>
            <p> Well after the shoot was done, Li admitted to me that he had a lot of insecurities within his mind during the shoot, about his talents as a director. Thing was, I never caught glimpse of them, ever. Li is the person who took a chance on me, he’s what Lady Gaga would call that “1 person in the room” but he also taught me a very valuable lesson about leaving your doubts at the door, and entering a set full of confidence. </p>

    <p> Personally, I lean more towards No. There is a bad habit out of there of actors putting more focus on the props in their scene, than the actual emotional journey of the scene itself. (been that actor myself!) So that is why I am not really for them.  </p>
    <p><i>HOWEVER</i>, I do believe there is merit in using a prop <i>OFF CAMERA</i> in many circumstances. These three props listed below can be used in your scene to provide you with more intricacies and thoughts. You get to use them to your advantage, but the camera and casting never get to see them. 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionOne"> Brush and Tweezers</h2>
            <p> The ol’ brush and tweezers trick is one that I find useful when your character is doing something extremely detailed and delicate. Here’s how you use it. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find a hairbrush, that has hair in it. </li>
                <li>Find tweezers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Play out your scene, and when it comes time for your character to do the intricate action, grab the brush and tweezers and slowly tweeze one hair at a time from the hairbrush. This requires precision, and if you allow yourself to focus on that action while doing the scene, some nice thoughts may appear on camera. </p>
            <p> The other great thing about this prop is that it’s silent. This means you can do it without it making noise and pulling focus from you and your scene. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> Folding a Napkin</h2>
            <p> Another great silent prop that can be useful in a scene is a napkin! 
            Folding a napkin is still a fairly intricate action, but less intricate than pulling hair out of a hairbrush. Here’s how you use it. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fold the napkin as many times as you want.</li>

            </ul>
            <p> What I love about the action of folding a napkin, is many times the napkin will unfold itself. This means you can do the action several times if it is required in your scene. The napkin trick is particularly useful if your character is doing something mundane and repetitive. </p>
            <p> <i>Storytime:</i></p>
            <p> <i>Years ago, I had a self-tape where the character I was playing was required to bag evidence, over and over and over again. She was talking to her colleague while sealing evidence bags. Since plastic bags are loud and distracting on camera, folding a napkin became my action. I’d reach off camera, grab an invisible rock, place it in my napkin, fold the napkin, and mime putting it to the side. I did this over and over again, until the scene required me not to - in this case, I was told something shocking and could not keep bagging evidence (or folding my napkin).</i> </p>
            <p> This does beg the question, why not mime all of it? The problem with miming is that unless you're a mime, miming something takes away all the specificity of that action - it also speeds it up quite a bit. Miming also removes active thought, it’s generalized and since your character is not actually miming that action, it puts a blanket of generality over what you do. Having a concrete object off-camera allows you to put back some specificity into the action, and handle something tangible. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Your Phone</h2>
            <p> This is the one prop, that I will say the camera can see if you are on a phone call. To me personally, the pinky-thumb mimed phone looks ridiculous and can really take someone viewing your audition, out of the scene. It’s very distracting. </p>
            <p> If you are a fan of the mimed phone, let me offer you a piece of knowledge that my high school drama teacher gave me, and once hearing it, I could never unhear it.</p>
            <p> <i>“When we mime holding a cup, we place our hand around the fake cup. When we mime a phone, our hand BECOMES the phone. Our thumb is the receiver, and our pinky is the transmitter. Unless you hold a phone between your thumb and pinky, you are wrongfully miming a phone.” </i></p>
            <p> I digress, but my suggestion is to always have your cellphone, or a prop phone (an old cell phone) to hold if your scene requires a phone call. This is the only time, I would suggest bringing the prop up into the scene for the camera to see.</p>
            <p> There are other times when you can use a phone as a prop, and not have it on camera. </p>
            <p> A phone is a great prop to have if you have to point a gun at someone in a scene. It gives just enough weight to your arm that can make it look believable that you are in fact yielding a gun.  (Miming a gun is similar to miming a phone = your hand becomes the gun.) If you want to properly portray holding a gun, make sure you hold your phone horizontally with one hand from the base, while your other hand cups the wrist of the hand holding the phone. </p>
            <p> Another great way to use your phone off-camera is if you are required to be scrolling, or distracted on your phone during the scene. We see this a lot in auditions now a day, because of the impact phones have on our day-to-day lives. It’s important to remember, that whatever your character is viewing on your phone will initiate some sort of feelings on your face. This is why I suggest putting something on your phone that matches that feeling. </p>
            <p> <i>For example:</i> If your character is giddy and looking at something that makes them smile or laugh, then pull up something that does that for you. Maybe a cute animal video. Or if your character is looking at something devastating or shocking, switch up what you put on your phone. Perhaps the news, or a pranks gone wrong video.</p>
            <p> What you see on your phone, will bring forward that emotion in your eyes and face and can help your audition, without ever having to have it be seen on camera. </p>
        </li>
       
        <li class="summary-li">
        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>At the end of the day, use or don’t use props as you wish. This blog is not law, you can do whatever you think is right for the scene. Just remember that whatever you do use for the scene adds to it, and doesn’t distract or take away. </p>
        </li>

    <p> Before we get into the various ways you can be a good reader. Let’s define what a reader is, for any of you who don’t know!  </p>

    <p> <b>READER:</b> A person who reads the other characters' lines in a scene, during an audition. Frequently this person allows the actor to have someone to play off of. This person can be anyone from a colleague, another actor, a casting director, a producer or even just a regular person who despite their best effort to avoid this job, knows an actor and has been asked to help them with their audition. </p>
    <p> Since the pandemic, becoming a reader has changed a little bit. Many more auditions are now done virtually, and so I have split each point into how it applies <i>In Person</i> and <i>Online.</i>  </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionOne"> Read the scene before the tape </h2>
            <p> <i>Applicable Online and In person:</i></p>
            <p> You don’t necessarily have to do any homework as a reader, but it does help to have some sort of understanding of what you’re reading for the audition. There are a few reasons for this. </p>
            <p> Firstly, no one likes to have a reader who has NO CLUE what they’re saying. It can be incredibly distracting for the actor and those viewing the tape if you sound like a 4th grader who was just called to read the next portion of the book assignment out loud. </p>
            <p> Second of all, it’s very possible that you will be reading more than one character as a reader, and it’s good to figure out when you are pausing for the actor to say their lines, and when you are to continue reading. </p>
            <p> Finally, a lot happens in auditions. It’s very likely there are cues in the action portion of the script (the part that isn’t dialogue) that could help cue the actor. Perhaps it’s a knocking at the door, a gunshot, a handing of a parcel..etc. If you know those are there, you can signal something with your body or make a sound effect to help your actor friend out. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> Read with intent and clarity</h2>
            <p> Despite what some people may say, it is incredibly important that the reader is heard clearly on the self-tape. Some will argue that producers and directors know the material, so it doesn’t matter that the reader is heard, but that is incorrect. Those watching the tape do know the material, but it’s not like they know it by heart. Also, they are watching so many audition tapes that it’s best to have them hear what the reader is saying. If they don’t, all it’s doing is distracting them from the actor’s acting. </p>
            <p> As a reader, you want to speak with intent, meaning no lifeless monotone delivery. Just sound like a normal person having a conversation, you’re invested and listening. We’ll get more into this point later with <i>Don’t out act the person on camera</i>.</p>
            <p> You also want to be clear, meaning you’re not mumbling, and you’re speaking at a normal pace that is understandable for those listening back.  </p>
            <p> <i> In-person:  </i></p>
            <p> Make sure you’re not so close to the camera mic, that you’re louder than the actor on camera. If you are behind the camera this shouldn’t be a problem. </p>
            <p> <i> Online:  </i></p>
            <p> Make sure you are close to your microphone, but not so close that you’re peaking the levels on their end. I would ask the actor before you start taping if the volume is good for them. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Make sure your space is quiet:</h2>
            <p> Obviously, when you are filming a self-tape, the space needs to be rid of any outside noises so as to reduce as much distraction as possible. </p>
            <p> <i> In-person:  </i></p>
            <p> Make sure your phone is off, so as not to interrupt the tape mid-scene. It helps if you aren’t wearing fabrics that make noise or any jewelry that could “jingle jangle” during the tape. Also, don’t chew gum while reading, that is a noise no one wants to hear during their tape. </p>
            <p> <i> Online:  </i></p>
            <p> Since you and the actor are not in the same space, make sure your online platform audio settings are set to minimize outdoor noise. On Zoom you can set the filter to High, Medium, Low, or Auto and this will keep out noises on your end like sirens or dogs barking. </p>
            <p> Another thing you can do, is if there is a particularly long monologue or part in the scene where you aren’t needed audibly, you can mute your microphone to avoid any accidental noises getting on their tape. I find this particularly useful in comedic scenes where all I want to do is laugh! </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFour"> Never stop the scene or correct the actor mid-scene</h2>
            <p> As a reader, you are there to facilitate the actor in their audition. Therefore you don’t have a say on when to cut the scene or stop it. Very often a scene will begin before the dialogue starts and end well after the last line has been said. </p>
            <p> A good practice is to follow what the actor does. Very likely if you have the first line in a scene, they may ask you to take a moment off the top, meaning they want you to give them some time to set the scene before you start speaking. The same can happen at the end of the scene. If you have the last line, they will want to take the time to react to what you said before ending the scene. </p>
            <p> Therefore, unless they break character, call cut or start speaking to you outside the scene, assume you’re in it. </p>
            <p> Another common mistake new readers make is they correct the actor on the lines. There are various beliefs on whether or not an actor needs to be script perfect in an audition, but for the sake of this blog, let’s assume that we don’t care for a few grammatical or paraphrasing errors. If the actor misses a word or screws up their line, try and keep going for their sake. If they feel it's unsalvagable, they’ll stop it.  </p>
            <p> <i> Online:  </i></p>
            <p> The only time I would say you can really stop a scene is if your online platform has completely frozen on you. In this case, I would give it some time to unfreeze, and if it’s not working, then you can say: “shoot you’re frozen” to which the actor can’t fault you for ruining their take, because they would have been silently waiting for your line on the other end anyway. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFive"> Provide an eye line</h2>
            <p> An eye line is where the actor is looking off-camera when doing the self-tape. This is a bit complicated in that it really depends on what sort of setup the self-tape is being done in. 
            If you are, as a reader, behind the camera, then standing to either the left of the lens or the right of the lens, can help the actor meet your eyes and act with you. Unfortunately, not every setup has that ability. 
            </p>
            <p> If you can meet their eyes, and it’s at the right height for the camera, then that’s a bonus! If you can’t, then there’s really nothing for you to do about that, and the actor will have to figure it out.</p>
            <p> <i> Online:  </i></p>
            <p> This doesn’t apply to online reading, as webcams are often either too low or too high to make direct eye contact with the person acting. Just make sure they can see your face, and even then, they may not even be able to see you while doing their tape if their online self-tape setup doesn’t allow it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionSix"> Don’t out-act the person on camera </h2>
            <p> Every actor has someone in their life they asked to read with, and then never read with again. This likely was because the person who was supposed to be behind the camera thought they were in front of it.  It’s in poor taste to try and outshine the person who is actually auditioning. </p>
            <p> Sometimes people do this unintentionally, they are just so excited to be helping an actor with a tape that they get dramatic and lost in the scene.</p>
            <p> As a good reader, you want to be slightly subdued. You do want to be engaging in the scene, but you aren’t going to get emotional or make the scene about you, because it's not about you.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionSeven"> Be Patient</h2>
            <p> This is easier to do if you are an actor and know the feelings, doubts, and judgments that arise during a self-tape. However, let it be known: as a reader, you are going to have to read that scene several times. Depending on who you are reading with, you may have to do the scene 4, 5,10, 20 times. Now personally I wouldn’t recommend any actor do 20 takes, however, you may be reading for someone who will do that many. 
            </p>
            <p> There is nothing worse than having a reader who doesn’t want to be there, whose energy is “you are wasting my time” or “we have to do it again?!” If you want to be a good reader for your actor friend/spouse/colleague then agree that you are there to help them until they feel they got it. If you can’t do that, don’t agree to read for them. </p>
            <p> As actors every audition is a chance to book a job, and it’s a chance that doesn’t come as frequently as we like. There are pressures, expectations, and nerves to auditioning, it helps if we don’t have a reader who is adding guilt or judgment on top of that.</p>
        </li>
       
        <li class="summary-li">
        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>Being a reader can actually be quite fun! You get to be transported into another world for a little bit and get to play various different parts across from the actor. It’s a place of giving and support. Quite frankly, also a place of play, which if you aren’t an actor is not something that is offered to us day to day. </p>
        <p>I hope you will be bold enough to send this to your new reader friend, whether it be your mom or your spouse, or perhaps a co-worker who has no idea what they’ve agreed to. 
        </p>
        <p>If you have been sent this, know that the actor who sent it to you trusts you immensely. We don’t ask just anyone to be a reader, we usually ask someone we trust, someone who supports us, and won’t judge our acting. So thank you, reader, for reading this, and being a part of our dream! </p>

    <p> With Valentines Day around the corner, I felt the need to tackle love and what it’s like to date an actor!  </p>
    <p> Maybe you are here because you just started dating an actor and have no idea what that adventure entails. Or, maybe you are an actor and want to pass along to your new hot thing, what they can expect. </p>
    <p> But let’s get those two questions that are burning inside you, answered first. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionOne"> Is it hard to date an actor? </h2>
            <p> It can be, but it doesn’t have to be. The main reason it would be hard to date an actor is that their life doesn’t fit into the societal 9-to-5 lifestyle. Set life is long hours and auditions are the equivalent of being on call. We have to accommodate them, despite them typically being last minute. </p>
            <p> It’s very likely that we could cancel plans to prep for an audition since every audition is an opportunity and not one that comes as often as we’d like. Or we may book a job, in which case you best believe we are dropping everything else in our schedule to work it. </p>
            <p> Another reason it may be hard to date an actor is the intimacy that we explore on set, for certain roles. It often can beg the question for non-actors:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> Do actors fall in love at work?</h2>
            <p> Intimate scenes with someone who isn’t your romantic partner can be just as awkward 
            for us as it is for you. In many cases, we meet the person we are going to be romantic with that same day! Not only that, but romantic scenes with kissing or sexual acts are all choreographed and are not as sexy as they seem in the final product. Don’t forget - we have an entire crew watching us while these intimate scenes happen!  </p>
            <p> I can’t say that actors don’t fall in love at work, since we see it all the time with celebrities, however, it’s just as common for actors to do the job and not feel a lick of desire from their acting colleagues. Either way, this is a conversation you need to have with your partner. Jealousy is likely to come up at some point, but it should never impede the job or the relationship.  As the non-actor, you need to trust that your romantic partner, who is an actor, values your relationship and won’t be swayed at work. It is our job, we take it seriously. That’s why: </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Actors need you to emotionally support and believe in them.</h2>
            <p> Actors work in an industry that is very unforgiving. We get rejected daily, and we are, in a lot of ways, seen as replaceable. In order to do what we love we have to fight very hard to get there. We need immense belief in ourselves, and as such we want our partners to do the same. We want you to be excited by our work, we want you at our shows, premieres, and galas, we want you to lift us up when the industry kicks us down, and most importantly, we want to jump up and down with you when we book a role. </p>
            <p> Your support indicates to us that you respect us and our dreams. I think every actor has dated someone who doesn’t take their job seriously, who mocks them or belittles their accomplishments, who downplay their successes. We already have inner critics for that, that isn’t your job. When you date an actor you are their cheerleader.</p>
            <p> The industry can be very cruel which is why, when you date an actor prepare yourself for:</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFour"> Dealing with the emotional ups and downs.</h2>
            <p> Unlike a typical 9-to5 job, as actors, we are technically freelance entrepreneurs, our talent, and image is the product we sell. And, we spend most of our time unemployed with the hope that our next audition will be a job. Our life could change overnight with the right booking, and this constant balancing act of “could this be it?” hangs over us and creates a rollercoaster of emotions. </p>
            <p> We can go from being devastated to not having auditioned in a few weeks, to perking right up when an audition comes through the door, to stressing about how to make it stand out, to being really proud of our work, to doubting our work, to getting excited over a callback, and back to depressed because we never heard back despite our best efforts.  This is very common and unfortunately may become somewhat contagious. 
            </p>
            <p> The reality is, when you date an actor you may find yourself immersed in their world. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionFive"> They may ask you to be their reader or rehearse with them</h2>
            <p> Due to the emotional rollercoaster mentioned above, as actors we want to make sure that the work we do is great work, and that we are prepared for our auditions, rehearsals, and working days. As such we will need to run our lines - and the best way to run lines is out loud with someone else. And you may be that someone. </p>
            <p> t’s very important that if we ask you, you are available and eager. This goes hand in hand with support. If you are a non-actor, you likely were not our first choice… or the second, we would much rather have someone who knows the craft to help us out. So, if we are asking you, we are in dire need of you and it’s possible that we also feel like a burden. The best thing you can do is say yes and let us tell you what we need. </p>

            <p> If we don’t ask you to be our reader, and you live with us expect that - </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2 id="sectionSix"> Actors need silence (get headphones!)</h2>
            <p> There are two reasons actors will need silence. Either they are auditioning or they are working their scene out loud. </p>
            <p> Audition quality is important. Putting aside talent or preparation, the technical aspects of auditioning are equally as important. The sound quality of an audition is at the top. We need to be heard clearly without any noise disruptions. Therefore, you cannot be listening to music loudly in the other room or it may pick up on our tape.  You should also make sure not to shower, run a blender or make any loud noises while we are taping. </p>
            <p> The other time we need silence is if we are working our scene out loud. This likely will look like this: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> We are pacing in a room with our sides in our hands  </li>
                <li> Repeating lines in different ways </li>
                <li> Reading things out loud </li>
                <li> Asking questions out loud </li>
                <li> Trying out different emotions…crying, yelling, laughing…etc </li>
            </ul>
            <p> Just overall being loud.  So when I say, get headphones, on the one hand, I say it for the actor, on the other I say it for your own sanity. You may not want to listen to us repeating the same line over and over. </p>
        </li>
               <li class="summary-li">
        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>Though it may seem like dating an actor is a lot of work, I do believe it is quite worth it. You will be dating someone who has drive, goals and dreams worth fighting for. They are curious about the human condition, and for that reason, you may find yourself heard and seen in ways you haven’t before. Since actors pursue feelings and how to communicate them, you will find yourself deeply loved and cared for and most likely intricately questioned about your emotional states. </p>
        </li>
        <p>Of course, not all actors are the same - so if you are reading this as someone who is a non-actor, please do me the favour of asking them what parts of this blog apply to them and what don’t! </p>
    </ol>

                    <p>Having been an actor for over a decade, and exploring many of the mediums the acting industry has to offer, I realized the hardest part of this craft is the lack of guidance. My hope in creating The Messy Actor is to provide advice, tips, and resources to provide answers for those who seek them. Learning allows growth, and growth allows freedom to play - I believe we are the best artists we can be when we are free to play & get messy. </p>
