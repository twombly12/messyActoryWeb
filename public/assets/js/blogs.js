         <p>Below are some tools to help you get started. One important thing to remember is that the acting industry is a strange one, and your journey within it will be unlike anyone else’s – you will have to navigate it as you see fit – hopefully
                        these tips can help you on your way.</p>
               </p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="doTheWork">Be willing to do the work</h2>
                            <p>There is a reason this tip is first: The road ahead of you will not be easy, and it’s best to accept the challenge before taking any steps forward. A wise professor of mine told me, “If there is anything else you’d rather do –
                                Do it.”</p>
                            <p>Acting can come with fame and money but it can also come with many burdens, tons of rejection and a lot of hard work. Yes, there are actors who are “found” in a coffee shop. And Yes there are people who have a birth-given talent,
                                however, in order to sustain a career in this industry, <b><em>hard work</em></b> is a <b><em>must</em></b>. This doesn’t mean that it can’t also be fun, just understand you have to be willing to do the work.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="network">Network with actors</h2>
                            <p>We are blessed to live in a technological age where videos, podcasts, and various apps can shower us with information. If you don’t know of any actors in your close circles, join an app like <em>Clubhouse</em> and sit in on the
                                acting rooms. You don’t even need to participate if you don’t want to! You can just sit and listen to what people in the room have to say. I urge you to bounce around to various rooms, and find people you vibe well with, and
                                then join the conversation. Ask questions, and be curious!</p>
                            <p>If you do know actors who are perhaps friends, or friends of friends – ask them out for a coffee date (or zoom date) to pick their brain. Seasoned actors generally love to help out those just joining the industry, and everyone
                                loves to give advice! Additionally, connections in this industry are vital – so the more people you meet, the better off you will be. <em>Note:</em> Make honest connections with the intention to learn as opposed to the intention
                                to be given something.</p>
                            <p>Finally, if all that seems way too daunting right now. You can start slow and listen to podcasts, YouTube videos, or even documentaries and behind-the-scenes videos on how movies are made.</p>
                        </li>

                            <h2 id="whatYouAreGoodAt">Find what you're good at</h2>
                            <p>In life you have acquired skills, whether it be mountain biking, swimming, video gaming…etc – and whether you believe it or not, these skills are going to help you in your acting career, one way or another.</p>
                            <p>These skills will be put on your resume eventually, so it’s best, while you are preparing to launch your career, you figure out what you are good at. Very often, when asked, people will say they have no skills, but this is never
                                true.</p>
                            <p>You may speak another language, or know how to do a particular accent, maybe you know bird calls or are a great cook – whatever it is – figure it out. Once you know what you are good at, start to practice and hone those skills
                                a little bit daily. You never know when a commercial, or role may require that skill.</p>
                            <p>When it comes to languages, knowing how to speak a language and how to do an accent of that language in English, is always handy. Ex: If you speak Chinese, being able to do a Chinese accent while speaking English is going to help
                                you immensely.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="studyActing">Go study acting</h2>
                            <p>In order to become an actor, you <strong><em>must</em></strong> train. This can be classes, or schooling, university, college, or even online classes. Whichever you choose, training is what will get you where you want to go. There
                                is no wrong answer when it comes to which kind of training you choose, but this will make or break you.</p>
                            <p>I am not fond of there being “hard rules” in this industry, because there aren’t any, really. However, on this blog, there is ONLY ONE rule – <strong>train. Train. TRAIN!</strong></p>
                            <p>You may be saying to yourself, “Well A list actors don’t train” – many do, however, if an A-list actor is working on set consistently, they are still working and training their acting muscles, so in fact – yes, they are training.</p>
                            <p>I think you get the point – GO TRAIN!</p>
                            <p>Google “Acting Classes” near you, no matter where you are, something will pop up. Many acting schools and classes allow students to <em>audit</em> classes, which means, you can go in and sit in a class to see how the coaches/teachers
                                work and what is expected of students. Very often audits are free, and on occasion, there is a small fee.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="headshots">Headshots</h2>
                            <p>Headshots are photos of yourself, that introduce you to the acting world. You will want to get these professionally done – they are an investment. A good headshot can get you in a room with very little experience, so it is worth
                                saving up some money to get good ones. However, play within your budget. If you can only afford the 100$ photographer at the moment, do that! Headshots can be changed as early as every year, and as late as every 5, as long
                                as you still look like yourself in them. <em>NOTE:</em> If the shot is good enough to get you into the room, you best believe you want the chops to back it up! (See Tip 4)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="beYourAgent">Be your own agent</h2>
                            <p>Once you have trained, got your headshots, and understand the basic functions of what is expected of you as an actor, it’s time to put yourself out there. This means becoming your own agent.</p>
                            <p>Very often, new actors receive the tip to “get an agent” right out of the gate. Many agencies will not consider you if you don’t have any experience or any way to show your talent or work ethic. This is why a great way to advance
                                your chances is to PUT THE WORK IN (See Tip 1) and get yourself some indie gigs!</p>
                            <p>Check out websites like mandy.com, castingworkbook.com, backstage.com, and others, where you can create a profile, apply to projects yourself and keep an eye on casting calls.</p>
                            <p><em>NOTE:</em> I strongly suggest staying off websites like Kijiji or Craigslist, they are not always safe and not industry standard.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="demoReel">Create a demo reel</h2>
                            <p>A demo reel is a series of short clips of your work as an actor. It shows what you are capable of and how you look on screen. Very often new actors will put class work on their demos, and though that is completely acceptable, you
                                can make yourself stand out by putting in a little bit more work.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, just like most working markets, the “work cycle” applies to the acting industry. The good old question “how do I get work without a resume, and how do I get a resume without work” does still apply here. However –
                                there is a gorgeous loophole! YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN WORK!</p>
                            <p>Though this might sound daunting, creating a minute, two-person scene, and filming it with a friend is very doable. Or, if you worry about your writing skills, you can always do a scene from a known film – just be sure to put your
                                own spin on it. If you can include any of your talents within these scenes, that’s a bonus!</p>
                            <p>The whole purpose of a demo reel is to have casting directors, directors and agents see you on camera – so be creative and put together something that your proud of. As time progresses, you will book work and be able to change
                                your demo to produced work, however for the time being – putting together something yourself will make you stand out from the pack.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="agent">Get an agent</h2>
                            <p>The tip you have all been waiting for. By the time you have headshots, and a demo – AND YOU’VE TRAINED, you can now scope out an agent. The reason this is the last tip is that every tip before this one will help you land an agent.
                       </p>
        
                            <p>Though I will always suggest you aim high, in this case, I would start with looking at boutique agencies that have fewer people on their roster. The reason for this is that they will have more time and energy to focus on growing
                                your career.</p>
                            <p>Very often, new actors who sign with huge agencies get lost in the shuffle, since the large agencies are focusing on their A-listers. With that being said, do apply to those agencies, you may as well – the worst thing that happens
                                is they say no.</p>
                                <p>When looking for an agent, there are many things to look out for, frankly, that’s a whole blog post in itself, which you can find here <a href="/8-things-to-avoid-in-an-acting-agent">Check out 8 Things to Avoid in an Acting Agent</a> However, the best tip I can give
                                you is to make sure you get along with the person you are signing with.</p>
                            <p>As a new actor, you will likely want someone who is friendly, and able to hold your hand as you maneuver the vast acting world. As such, you want to make sure you get along with them and are comfortable having a business relationship
                                with your agent.</p>
                                <p>Just remember that becoming an actor takes a lot of patience in time, even after you have done these steps, there are a lot of challenges and continual upkeep you will have to do. Becoming an actor is a commitment to the craft, and to the lifestyle. It may be a tumultuous journey, but keep your head high, and put the time in. You got this! </p>

You may just be getting started, but if you are in this for the long haul, you will allow yourself patience and understanding as you grow and develop in this industry.  This really is the case where slow and steady wins the race! (And fun fact, the race is life - not the job!)  </p>

                    <p>As talented as you are, an agent will not be reaching out to you out of the blue. Agents are incredibly busy with their current talent, and though it may be a blow to your ego - they just don’t care enough about you, to reach out if you don’t have experience.</p>
                    <p>There is a romanticization in the industry about “being found”, and it’s best to nip that idea in the bud early, as it’s just not true. Frankly, it’s an idea formed by laziness, that you won’t have to do any work to be discovered. So with that in mind, if you aren’t going to be found - those claiming that you have been, are likely trying to scam you.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionTwo"> THEY WON’T MEET YOU  </h2>
                    <p>These scam agents’ jobs are really to collect an abundance of talent so that they can make money. They really don’t care about you as a person or your career. So it is likely, they won’t care to meet you or get to know you at all after reaching out. A common practice is to get you to sign a contract and change your representation status very quickly, so they make sure you are on their roster.</p>
                    <p>The good news is, it’s very easy to test out if you are interacting with this sort of agent. Simply ask them if they are willing to have a meeting to discuss compatibility, your prior works, and your career moving forward. Most scam agents won’t take the time for this, they will try to find a way out of the meeting, and pressure you to sign a contract.</p>
                    <p>It is rare, but I have heard of some scam agents who will meet you. Usually, these meetings take place in a location outside of their office, like a hotel, or an office that is “under construction”. They will bring the contract for you to sign on the spot, which is not industry standard. A good way to sway this type of meeting is to ask to meet at their office, during work hours, and ask to take the contract home so you can read it over.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionThree"> THEY PROMISE YOU WORK  </h2>
                    <p>Another wonderful untrue idea is that an agent can get you a job. They are a means to a job, yes, but they have no pull in getting you the “Lead in a feature film”. Or getting you “on set with Brad Pitt.”  If anyone promises you a booking - they are lying. This is one of the biggest red flags that scam agents use, and unfortunately, one of the lies that really excites new actors.</p>
                    <p>As a metaphor - an agent is a dating app - they cannot promise you will meet the love of your life, fall in love, and live happily ever after. They simply can present you with options (auditions) and hope the stars align.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionFour"> THEY MAKE  YOU  BUY THEIR PORTFOLIO </h2>
                    <p>Upon meeting an agent, <strong><em>no money should be exchanged</em></strong>. It is very common that scam agencies will tell you you have to purchase their headshot package in order to get started. Or you have to take their recommended acting classes in order to be seen. This is not how the industry works.</p>
                    <p>Sure, an agent may recommend you shoot with a certain photographer, or take classes with a specific teacher - but none of that costs money. It’s your choice in the end, who will shoot your headshots and who you will train with. Your agent gets no money for either of those things.</p>
                    <p>Another common thing scam agents will do is say they have a “business fee” which covers all printing, and online workings of your casting profiles. Another lie. Your agent will be paid when you book a job, <strong><em>that’s it</em>.</strong> Which introduces the next point -</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionFive"> THEY TAKE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OFF YOUR PAYCHEQUE </h2>
                    <p>Some scam agencies are more clever than others. Some know that new actors have been warned of the signs, and so they have adjusted their way of scamming. One way is to take a higher percentage of your paycheque, this removes the “fee” red flag from their dealings.</p>
                    <p>It does depend on where you live, and you can search the proper percentages of your local area online. However, in the U.S., U.K., and Australia, the standard is 10%, any more than that and you are likely dealing with a scam agency. In Canada, there are different percentages depending on what medium you have booked. The standard is 15%, however, for print, it can be 20% and for theatre, it can be 10%.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionSix"> THEY NAME DROP SUCCESS STORIES </h2>
                    <p>Listen, we can all be proud of our successes, and for agents, their talent succeeding is definitely something to brag about. However, any name in the industry that you would recognize - won’t be bragged about by some agent that reached out to you. <em>Jennifer Lawrence’s agent is not scouting for new actors.</em></p>
                    <p>Additionally, an agent meeting is not the place for “others” successes. It’s about you and the agent’s relationship, and quite frankly, the focus should solely be on you. If they don’t want to get to know you and are dropping famous names in every other sentence, you can be sure, they are trying to scam you.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionSeven"> THEY HAVE A SIDE HUSTLE AS WELL </h2>
                    <p>Yes, times are hard. As a new actor, you are probably more familiar with that than most. However, an established agent will be doing just fine and will not require a “side-hustle”. More importantly, they will not be letting you know they have one.</p>
                    <p>You best believe, if an agent is telling you what other things they do for work, they are telling you upfront they won’t be putting your needs first. You want an agent who will be hungry to get you auditions and hope you succeed, so if they are telling you about their “protein drink business” you can also be a part of - Run. No one likes a pyramid scheme, especially when it’s coming from someone who is looking to be your agent!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2 id="sectionEigth"> THEY NEED TO ADVERTISE THEIR AGENCY </h2>
                    <p>Agents don’t advertise. It’s as simple as that. Not on the radio, not online, nowhere. If you see an ad for an agency, do not apply.</p>
                    <p>In fact, in Canada talent agents have a code of ethics that they should be following. One of the points in that code of ethics is “An agent will not advertise to the general public for the purpose of soliciting clients.” If you live outside of Canada, it is very likely your state or province has something similar that holds agents to an ethical standard.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="summary-li">
                <h2 id="summary" >Summary</h2>
                <p>It may seem that getting an agent is a little scary, however, it’s better to know what is out there and be prepared. One of the reasons I am so adamant about training, (which you can see in <a href="/8-tips-on-how-to-become-an-actor">8 TIPS ON HOW TO BECOME AN ACTOR</a>) is that not only does it prepare you with the skill of acting, but it also is a barrier against these scam agents. Scam agencies do not want someone who knows what they are doing. Training also allows you a safe community to talk to other actors about their experiences with agencies and agents, which is another method that keeps you safe.</p>

                    <p>The blog below is going to prepare you for the practices of a good agent, and what you can expect. If you want to know what practices you can do to be a good client, see <a href="/6-ways-to-have-a-better-relationship-with-your-agent">(6 WAYS TO HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR AGENT)</a></p>

                            <h2 id="sectionOne"> THEY COMMUNICATE WELL </h2>
                            <p>One of the bases of all great relationships is communication. A great agent will know how to communicate effectively. They will respond to your emails and phone calls promptly. Additionally, they will be clear on what they are communicating. With all the tools that email platforms have now a day (highlighting, bolding, italicizing, snooze, schedule send..etc), it makes it very easy for an agent to be clear and prompt.</p>
                            <p><em> What shouldn’t happen:  </em></p>
                            <p>You should never receive an email from your agent that is a stream of consciousness, all in caps or unclear. If you don’t know the purpose of the email, or you aren’t sure what to do with the information, they aren’t doing their job correctly.</p>
                            <p><strong><em> Example of Good Communication  </em></strong></p>
                            <img src="../assets/images/5-things-to-expect-from-your-talent-agent/good example.PNG" alt="example of good communication from an acting agent">

                            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL  </h2>
                            <p>It is easy to forget that the relationship with your agent is a business relationship. Over time, and as you get to know them better, it can become more friendly, however, there always does need to be a sense of professionalism and respect. This means they speak to you as they would speak to someone they work with.</p>
                            <p>To put it in a different light, let’s just say - if you would report HR on them in a 9 - 5 job, then it’s unacceptable in this situation as well.</p>
                            <p>The only exception to this is if you are both discussing anything to do with changing your look, size charts, and something that may directly affect your appearance. In this industry, appearance does play a part, but this conversation should be consensual on both sides and dealt with respect as well.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionThree"> THERE IS A MONEY TRAIL </h2>
                            <p>When you book a job, your agent will be handling the payment side of things. They will take their cut, and then send the money off to you. A good agency and legitimate agent will have a breakdown on how much you received, what their cut was, taxes, and any other breakdown on where the money goes. You should be privy to all that information.</p>
                            <p>If an agent is not paying you, e-transfering you random amounts, or behind on payments, you need to assess whether or not your agent/agency is any good.</p>
                            <p>These rules may vary depending on what province or state you are in, however, typically:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A non-union job has between 30 - 90 days to get you your payment</li>
                                <li>A union job has 2 weeks to get you your payment</li>
                                <li>An agent has 7 days to receive their cut and send the cheque on to you</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFour"> THEY HOLD THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE </h2>
                            <p>Another wonderful trait that serves well in everyday life is accountability. It is particularly important that your agent has this personality trait. The last thing you want is someone blaming you for their mistakes, the industry is stressful enough.</p>
                            <p>Now listen, there are a lot of irons in the fire when you are an agent. They are handling as little as, auditions, tapes, and bookings and as much as agency meetings, casting phone calls, contracts, booking conflicts…etc. So it’s likely that here or there, a mistake may be made. If they apologize and correct it, you can assume you have a good agent representing you.</p>
                            <p>If however, they start making up excuses as to why the error happened, or who was to blame, or you feel there is a gossipy element to their reasoning, you may be represented by someone who doesn’t have your best interest in mind.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFive">  THEY SUPPORT YOU AND YOUR CAREER </h2>
                            <p>Your agent doesn’t need to hold your hand, by any means, but you want to feel supported in your relationship with your agent. You want to feel seen, and that you are both fighting for the same cause: YOUR CAREER.</p>
                            <p>If you are putting in the work, you should feel they are as well. You should feel confident asking your agent questions about the industry. Additionally, there should be a sense that they are pushing and rooting for you. If your agent is getting you “pushes” for certain roles or fights to get you an audition. You can best believe they have your career in mind.</p>
                            <p> On the flip side of this, your agent should also understand your need for time off and living your life as well. You should be able to book out any time you need, be it for personal reasons or events in your life. You are not a machine, and a good agent will understand this.</p>
                            <p>The same goes for declining parts. Assuming you don’t go around declining every audition you get, your agent should be happy with you regretting an audition, particularly if it’s a role you don’t feel comfortable doing.</p>
                        </li>

                        <p>At the end of the day, you want to find someone you get along with, and want to work with. You don’t need to see your entire future with them, there are agents who are stepping stones, but even an agent who is bringing you to the next level should add value to your career at that point in time. If you feel your agent is lacking in one of these categories, communicate that with them. All relationships require work - be sure to put the effort in to make this one flourish as well.

                    <p>There are three different beliefs when it comes to agent-client relationships. There is the belief that your agent works for you, the belief that you work for your agent, and the belief that it is an equal business partnership.</p>
                    <p>I personally am of the opinion of #3, the equal business partnership. I think this version of looking at the relationship allows both parties to bring their strengths and in turn create a successful future for your career.</p>
                    <p>My hope is you are here because you want to create a positive dynamic between you and your agent, and you want to know what is expected of you in this relationship. My fear is that some of you have come under false intentions to push your agent to work for you. A brief reminder that your intentions are also very important when it comes to solidifying a strong relationship with your agent.</p>
                    <p>Below are some things you can do that will continue to support a strong relationship with your agent.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionOne"> BE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT OPPoRTUNITY </h2>
                            <p>As an actor, you never know when your next opportunity (be it audition or booking) will come. It is a world we have very little control over. But, what you do have control over is your preparation. This means, train - so that when the audition comes you can deliver your best work.</p>
                            <p>This also means, having your demo reels, headshots, resumes, websites up to date. If your agent doesn’t need to chase you for this information, you make their job a lot easier.</p>
                            <p>Being prepared also means doing a thorough job on your auditions. Put the work into your auditions and submit your self-tapes before the deadline.</p>
                            <p>Be someone that your agent can count on, as opposed to someone who they have to babysit. Additionally, if you are prepared and your agent feels they are in good hands when working with you, you have already given them a reason to push and fight for you. Many agents have large rosters, so don’t give them a reason to pick someone else to fight for.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> PRIORITIZE TIME MANAGEMENT  </h2>
                            <p>It is very likely that you will be asked to audition several times a week. Being organized means you can handle your auditions, bookings, side jobs, and personal life. It means you are able to get your audition in before the deadline, while also working your side job, because you know how to handle your schedule.</p>
                            <p>Knowing your schedule is helpful when you get Availability Checks for bookings. It is also possible you will book more than one job at a time. (I wish this for all of you) It’s important you know when those outside dates for both jobs are, in case there are any overlaps. Additionally, some of you have more than one agent, in more than one country, so knowing the scheduling of your bookings and communicating them to your agents is very important.</p>
                            <p>Another organizational skill that can be very handy, is keeping track of your auditions. ( <a href="/14-things-to-keep-track-of-when-you-auditions">See  14 THINGS TO KEEP TRACK OF WHEN YOU AUDITION</a> for a more in-depth look at what to keep track of) If you have an understanding at the end of the year of who’s auditioned you, and how many auditions you’ve had. You can have a discussion with your agent on who you’d like to see more of, and what direction you want your next year to go.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionThree"> GET TO KNOW YOUR TALENT AGENT </h2>
                            <p>This point goes beyond the industry, and beyond your career - though it may very well help your career. Your agent is human and one of the best ways to nurture this client-agent relationship is to treat them as such. Your agent will have interests, and hobbies that go beyond the industry, and knowing these things can come in handy when events such as the holidays come up.</p>
                            <p>Now I’m not saying you need to inorganically create moments to find these things out, however, when given the opportunity, it’s always good to ask questions and find out more about them. If you are someone who wants to follow their agent on social media, this is also a great way to see what their interests are.</p>
                            <p>Another really good reason to do this is that if you know what kind of person your agent is, this allows you to better communicate with them.</p>
                            <p>Here is a story I find quite charming:</p>
                            <p>A colleague of mine was in the habit of sending bottles of wine to his representation around the holidays. One day, he was talking to his agent and casually he asked: Did you find the Merlot this year better or worse than last year’s? The agent paused and said: I don’t know… I actually don’t drink wine - but my assistant loved it.  It turns out, in the seven years my colleague was represented by his agent, he didn’t realize his agent didn’t drink wine! You can imagine the embarrassment. Thankfully, it was all in good fun, and it sparked the conversation “well what do you like?” and my colleague found out his agent loved IPA’s.</p>
                            <p>Though this story ended with an inside joke and a closer relationship - it can also save you 7 years of bad gift giving!</p>
                            <p>Let me be clear, getting to know them is not only for gift giving. It comes in handy when you know how they prefer to communicate (email/text/phone),  when they answer emails, which topics are out of bounds…etc.  All these things, will help bring you two closer together - and in turn create a powerful relationship in which your career can blossom from.</p>

                            <h2 id="sectionFour"> KNOW WHEN TO COMMUNICATE AND WHEN TO BE PATIENT </h2>
                            <p>For new actors who have recently signed with an agent, it may seem daunting knowing when to contact your agent and when not to. The answer to this is:  don’t be afraid to contact them.</p>
                            <p>There are however reasons to contact them that are better than others.</p>
                            <p><b><em>Good Reasons</em></b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>You have a question about an audition, a booking, or something they can answer that you don’t know </li>
                                <li>You are on hold, and the date is a day away and you haven’t heard whether you booked it or have been released</li>
                                <li>You are on set and something has come up that you didn’t know about, or expect. (I.e. Nudity) </li>
                                <li>You are booking out </li>
                                <li>Someone contacted you for work but didn’t go through your agent. </li>
                                <li>An emergency - whether it be something happened to you or a loved one, and you need to take some sudden time off. </li>
                                <li>You got new headshots, or cut together a new demo reel and want feedback</li>
                                <li>You want to have a yearly meeting to go over goals</li>
                                <li>You saw an audition that you want to submit for</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b><em>Not So Good Reasons</em></b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To check and see if they heard back about an audition</li>
                                <li>To ask them why you haven’t gotten any auditions in a while</li>
                                <li>To ask questions that you can answer yourself - (i.e. to interpret a character or what you should wear for an audition) </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This point should not make you fear reaching out to your agent, but it should make you think about how you are using their time the most effectively. Certain agents are more gracious at holding their actor's hands, and others would prefer you took initiative. The best way to figure this out is by asking them what they prefer.</p>

                            <h2 id="sectionFive"> UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR ACTING AGENT DOES </h2>
                            <p>Knowing what your agent does will also help you understand what you are supposed to do. The easiest way to find out this information is to ask them when you have your first meeting. Some agencies delegate different jobs to different agents. Others, the agent may be doing everything from getting auditions to accounting.</p>
                            <p>In the states, actors have managers and agents. Both do very different jobs. If you are unaware of what those are - it works in your best interest to ask them. Your manager may deal with certain aspects of your career, while your agent deals with others. If you know what they do, you will know who to go to with any questions you have.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionSix"> BE AVAILABLE FOR AUDITIONS AND BOOKINGS </h2>
                            <p>I am always astounded at how often I hear actors turning down auditions. It is in your right to turn down auditions, yes. However, it is in your best interest in booking work, NOT TO.</p>
                            <p>Part of the reason I believe many actors, particularly new ones, turn down auditions is that they don’t recognize the weight of getting one.</p>
                            <p>When you get an audition you have already won.</p>
                            <p>What I mean by that is, you have been personally selected from hundreds of applications to audition for this part. The casting director saw your headshot, (and maybe your demo reel) and thought you could play that part. So - make yourself available.</p>
                            <p>Particularly now where practically every audition is a self-tape, do your best to make the time Also, after a certain amount of declines, your agent will feel submitting you is a waste of their time, and your auditions will decrease. Not out of spite for you, but they will turn their attention to someone more deserving of their time.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="summary-li">
                        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
                        <p>If you have any doubt about any of these points, the one to drive home is the golden rule: don’t be a jerk. Being someone who is pleasant to work with goes a long way. You can be disorganized, or occasionally not be fully prepared, but as long as you are hitting deadlines, trying your best and being kind, your agent will thank you. </p>
                        <p>As one final takeaway;, I have heard actors say that “the agent hasn’t put the work in to get to know me so why should I.”  My personal opinion on this matter is the following:  Your agent has 20,30, maybe even 50 more people they are managing. If you want them to put the effort into getting to know you, you should show them why it is worth it. If you aren’t willing to do that, ask yourself which of the following beliefs from above you have - 1 ,2 or 3.  </p>
                        </p>

                    <p>Keeping track of the facts of your auditions is important for growth, and goal setting. Many actors believe they can just remember certain information, like what casting directors brought them in, or what they’ve auditioned for. However, without a proper way of cataloging these facts - you can lose sight of them very quickly.</p>
                    <p>You can either make your own Audition Book, or you can purchase one, like the linked below. 
                    <div class="cta"></div>
                </p>
                    <p>Below are the various things you should keep track of when auditioning, and why.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionOne"> Date & Time of Audition </h2>
                            <p>This one seems pretty self-explanatory. Having the date you auditioned, not only helps you see how many auditions you got in a week/month/ year, but also allows you to categorize your auditions chronologically.</p>
                            <p>The time can vary. If it is a self-tape, put the time it is due by - that helps you remember the due date. If it is a ZOOM or In-Person audition, put the time you are called in for.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> Type of Audition </h2>
                            <p>With the various types of ways to audition now, be it in the room, zoom, voice-over mp3, or selftape, it’s good to keep a log as to what type of audition is expected of you, and what you sent in/or attended.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Casting Director / Casting House </h2>
                            <p>As you create various relationships with casting, it’s important to know who is bringing you in, how frequently you’re seen by them, and then alternatively who isn’t bringing you in. At the end of the year, when you set your goals, you can let your agent know which casting agents you’d like to see more of.</p>
                            <p>Knowing who brings you in is also a great way to feel good about the work you do - if a casting director consistently brings you in, they like your work! Additionally, if you notice a certain casting director bringing you in quite a bit, at the end of the year it doesn’t hurt to send them a holiday card, to show your appreciation.</p>
                            <p>Certain casting houses have more than one casting director, if that is the case, make sure you put both the name of the casting house, and which casting director was the one who brought you in.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFour"> Network  / Production Company </h2>
                            <p>Knowing this information is very important when auditioning because it lets you know the mood and genre of the audition. It’s also important in terms of tracking it.</p>
                            <p>If you are auditioning constantly for Netflix or Hallmark, this tells you where casting sees you and can be helpful in training. Either, you train to feed into your strengths and/or you work to train and shape your career to go out for networks and companies you want to be seen by, (if what you are going out for isn’t to your liking).</p>
                            <p>Additionally, if you are auditioning for commercials, this is a good place to put which product is auditioning you. Since many companies have different ads going around - you can put the company name here, and the type of commercial audition under the project name. For ex: COMPANY - McDonalds PROJECT NAME - McNuggets</p>

                            <h2 id="sectionFive"> Director & Previous Works </h2>
                            <p>Just like all the other points above, if you notice that you keep seeing the same director, this is a good indicator that they like your work, or you are going out for similar projects. Knowing the director and their previous works allows you to get an understanding on who you could be working with. A quick IMDB check of their previous credits, and a quick YouTube of a trailer of their work is always helpful. If there isn’t anything, that’s okay - there is no harm in putting their name down, to see if there is a trend.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionSix"> Writer & Previous Works </h2>
                            <p>Same reasoning applies here as with the Director notes above. However, it’s always good to see if the Director and the Writer are the same person. If this is the case, it’s good to pay extra attention to the words of the script, because the person you are auditioning for is auditioning to fill the roles of their baby (i.e. The script)</p>
                            <p>Seeing what a writer's previous works are also allows you to see what their genre of work generally entails. If you can recognize some of the previous work, it may give you an understanding of the world the writer lives in.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionSeven"> Project Name </h2>
                            <p>Another pretty evident reason why you want this in your logging. 
                       </p>
                            <p>One thing to keep in mind here, many auditions, unless an already running show, may have a working title, for secrecy or because they haven’t found a name for it yet. Your agent may have an idea what the actual title of the show or film is. If they don’t, that’s okay - leave some room for what the title actually becomes. This way, if you don’t book it, but end up seeing it later on TV, you can make a comparison to your audition and the actual show. 
                       </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionEight"> Role Name </h2>
                            <p>Who are you auditioning for - What is their name? This will directly correlate to your sides.</p>
                            <p>If you are auditioning for a commercial, and you are simply MALE HERO - that is still important to include.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionNine"> Role Type </h2>
                            <p>You can write whether it’s a PRINCIPAL/ GUEST STAR/ LEAD… etc if it is listed. Or you can list what sort of character it is: “30s’ Biker” for example. You are more than welcome to add both, so you can see if there is a trend in what you go out for.</p>
                            <p>This can help for training - you are able to see what “type’ you are being seen for, and work on playing into that, or alternatively work to train against that so you can go out for parts you want to go out for.</p>
                            <p>Keep in mind also, what you are going out for may also have something to do with your headshots <a href="http://localhost:5000/5-things-to-know-about-headshots">(SEE 5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT HEADSHOTS</a> for more details about this point)</p>

                            <h2 id="sectionTen"> Personal Notes </h2>
                            <p>The personal notes section is entirely up to you. Many actors like to write their feelings about the audition, whether they felt it went well, what they wore, how they were feeling before, if anything happened during, before or after that may have altered how the audition went… etc. This is up to you to pick how thorough you want to be.</p>
                            <p>These notes are particularly useful if you get a callback, you can decide whether you want to wear the same thing, or look back and see what your headspace was at the time of the audition.</p>
                            <p>One of the things that I would suggest you do, is make any notes about things you may have discussed in the audition that didn’t have to do with the audition itself. If you spoke to the casting director about their favorite music, or the director told you about their dog, these are all good things to write down, in order to remember them down the road. 
                       </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionEleven"> Feedback </h2>
                            <p>This category may rarely get used. It isn’t very frequently that you will receive feedback from casting - however, your agent may give you a comment or two. So - it is worth writing down, if not only for your ego, to remember good things said about your work. And, as always if there is constructive feedback, this is something you can take into your next audition to allow growth.</p>
                            <p>The odd time you do receive feedback, this could be from a director or casting telling you how to alter your callback or tape for a better chance of being considered for the role. Sometimes when we audition we don’t understand the genre or the type of comedy/drama needed, and can feedback can get us on the right track.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionTwelve"> Callbacks, Holds & Bookings </h2>
                            <p>If you are creating your own notebook. Find a fun way to mark these three. I personally enjoy stamps, so I have three different stamps, with different coloured ink that I use when I get any one of these. The stamps make it easy for me to see where I got callbacks, holds and bookings and how often. It doesn’t have to be stamps however, it can be stickers, highlighters, smiley faces, whatever brings you joy.</p>
                            <p>If you bought the audition book, you can simply check off, or highlight the box in order to keep track.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionThirteen"> Catalogue Number </h2>
                            <p>There are two types of cataloging that you should have within your audition book. You should number the audition WITHIN THE YEAR. For example: #3 (within the year 2022) and you should number the audition OVERALL. For example #245 (between the year 2017 - 2022) This way you can see how many auditions you have ever done and how many auditions you did that year alone.</p>
                            <p>Generally the yearly number goes beside the date, and the overall  number goes at the bottom of the audition, but there is no right way to do this.</p>
                            <p>I personally also like to number my sides as well, and give them a number alongside my audition number. Since some auditions, generally commercials, tend to be SOC (silent on camera) there are no sides that come along with it. So the audition number, and the sides number can differ.</p>
                            <p>You don’t need to number your sides if you aren’t printing them and keeping them. However, if you do keep them, even electronically, it may be worth giving them a number.</p>
                            <p>If you are printing your sides and breakdowns, and keeping them in an additional binder, numbering them in accordance with your overall audition number and your sides number can be very useful if you want to go back to your sides on a later date. Let me give you an example, as this may sound very confusing, but I promise you it isn’t.</p>
                            <p><strong><em> EXAMPLE: </em></strong></p>
                            <p>The audition is for <em>THE WITCHER</em> -</p>
                            <p>It is your <strong>289th</strong> audition of your entire career.</p>
                            <p>It is the <strong>148th</strong> audition that has had sides.</p>
                            <p>So - at the end of your audition logging you would write:</p>
                            <p> <strong>#289 S#148</strong>  (s for sides)</p>
                            <p>You would also write those numbers on your sides & the breakdown if you print them out, so that you can find them later in your binder and tie them back to your notebook.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFourteen"> The Yearly Tally </h2>
                            <p> If you are making your own notebook, you can decide whether you want this at the beginning or end of your notebook.</p>
                            <p><strong><em>Your yearly tally should have:</em></strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>how many auditions you had in the year</li>
                                <li>how many were commercials, film, tv</li>
                                <li>how many callbacks you had</li>
                                <li>how many holds</li>
                                <li>how many bookings </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>And anything additional you find pertinent information for your growth and goal setting. 
                       </p>
                            <p>If you have bought the notebook linked above, you will notice that it is the very first page of your notebook. This way makes it easier to a) remember you have to fill it in at the end of the year b) makes it easier to find if you go looking for it.</p>

                    <p> 
                    <p><em>What is a headshot?</em> A headshot is a professional photo of your face, generally shoulders up, that looks like you. It’s purpose is to get you into the audition room. Long story short - a headshot is your business card.  A good headshot will be memorable enough to get you into various rooms, generic enough that it looks like you most of the time, and specific enough to slot you into various role categories. </p>
                    <p><em>What do I need them for?</em> Most importantly, headshots are used to “sell” you to casting directors. This means agents (or yourself if you are not represented) use the photo to persuade casting directors to get you into the room for an audition. In situations like open calls,your headshot is also used to remember what you looked like when you've entered the room. </p>
                    <p>Now, in our predominantly online world, headshots are also used for casting websites and marketing purposes. If you are being sent out for audition submissions by your agent online, your only method to getting an audition is your headshot. Some people post their headshots on their social media platforms as well. </p>
                    <p>Now that we’ve summarized what they are, here are some things you should know about headshots if you are going to get them done, or already have. 
                     </p> </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionOne"> What You See is What You Get </h2>
                            <p> Casting directors are incredibly busy, they don’t have the time to imagine what you can go out for,so what your photo evokes is likely what role you will audition for. For example: If you look angelic and innocent in your headshot, the roles you go out for will likely be in that vein. This is why you want to figure out a) what you want to go out for and b) what kind of roles you naturally look like.   </p>
                            <p> If your A and B don’t match up, then deliberately curate your headshots so that you have options for both.  </p>
                            <p> If you have a “harder” look but you want to be cast in Hallmark movies, then find ways you can make your look softer, and more innocent, and vice versa. If you have a very innocent look, but you want to play “grungier” roles, put together a wardrobe,make up or aesthetic that would persuade a viewer in that direction.  </p>
                            <p> It is important that before you go to your headshot session you have thought about what kind of photos you want by the end of the session.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionTwo"> They Have to Look Like You </h2>
                            <p> A very common misconception with new actors when they are told to “curate” their headshots, is they show up as someone else.  </p>
                            <p> Your headshots <em>must</em> look like you.  </p>
                            <p> A great rule to follow is: If the casting director bumped into you first thing in the morning before you showered or put on your face, they would recognize you. Essentially, your headshot is a slightly glamorized version of your natural self.  </p>
                            <p> The curation of a headshot is subtle. It could be the difference between a collared shirt or a leather jacket. Natural make- up vs. darker eye-shadow.  </p>
                            <p> You can do whatever you want, but my suggestion is, leave the hair extensions, fake eyelashes, and toupees, at home. Or, bring them for ONE of your shots, for variety, but don’t have them in all your photos. Now, if you are a woman of color and you wear hair pieces everyday, then this is where you can ignore that suggestion.   </p>
                            <p> When it comes to glasses, if you wear them all the time, bring them to your headshot session. Take some photos with them, and take some photos without. Additionally, if you have facial hair, you should take photos with it, and some without. It is extremely common for casting directors to  ask for a photo of you clean shaven.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionThree"> Headshots Are an Invesment </h2>
                            <p> Since headshots are your first impression with casting, it’s important that you have a professional photo. Many actors find the pricing of headshots to be quite a difficult bill to swallow, however if there is any cost worth spending, it’s on good headshots. If you get shots you like, you can use them for 3-5 years, or more if your look doesn’t change.  </p>
                            <p> With that being said, this doesn’t mean spending $1,500 on headshots because the price gets you the best photo. It simply means, don’t take a selfie and pass it off as a headshot. I have seen new actors crop group photos, or use passport photos as their headshots - <b>don’t do that</b>. Go to a studio with a photographer who knows what they're doing. Lighting, poses, and an understanding of what type of photo you want will greatly increase getting great results.   </p>
                            <p> I would strongly recommend hiring a makeup artist. Don’t assume just because you do your make up everyday that you can do make up for a professional shoot. </p>
                            <p> This is why headshots are considered an investment, because you are not only paying for your photos, you are paying for your make-up, your edits and prints.  </p>
                            <p> But at the end of the day, these photos will hopefully get you into the audition room, which is one step closer to booking the job, and paying that investment off!  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h2 id="sectionFour"> Commercial Photos vs. Theatrical Photos </h2>
                            <p> If you are tight for money, and can only get two different looks in your headshot session, make sure you get one commercial shot and one theatrical shot.  </p>
                            <p> A commercial shot is a photo that looks entirely like you, natural and “family friendly”. A good indicator of a commercial photo is something you would see in stock photography. You look like you are someone people want to work with, and a company would want you as the face of their product.  </p>
                            <p> A theatrical photo is one that fits into more of a character category. These photos are used for film, tv and theater, where the photo indicates a lean towards a genre or type of person. An example I keep going back to is “biker” but it can also be “business professional” “student” “mother” “villain” “blue collar worker” etc etc.  </p>
                            <p> The main way you would curate these two shots is by wardrobe. A business professional look would likely have a blazer or a collared shirt. A harder look may involve a leather jacket, or a sleeveless top. The other way is by how you pose in the photo, but more of that in subsequent points below.  </p>
                            <p> A wonderful way to understand these various looks is to look up headshots on Pinterest. Make a board of the looks you want to replicate in your headshot session. It’s an easy way to figure out what kind of wardrobe, make up and poses you want to bring in.  </p>

                            <h2 id="sectionFive"> Your Eyes are the Windows to … the Room </h2>
                            <p> A good headshot has “something about it”. Generally this “something” comes from the thoughts that are behind your eyes. They say that the eyes are the windows to the soul, and as such, your thoughts in your photo give the viewer a glimpse of that.  </p>
                            <p> If you look at a headshot and you wonder “what is that person thinking” or “what was going on when they took that photo”, that is memorable. That is what will make you stand out.  </p>
                            <p> Very often new actors will get headshots and the proofs show a “deer in the headlights” look or a “dead look”, which often comes from a discomfort or fear during the session. A way to combat these issues, and make sure you get your money’s worth from your headshot session, is to prepare thoughts.  </p>
                            <p> These thoughts should come through your eyes. They can be anything you want. My suggestion is you think thoughts towards the camera, as if they are a character. “I like you” “I will get you” “I am better than you”...etc.  The viewer won’t know what you were thinking, but they will know there is something captivating about your headshot, and that is the goal!  </p>
                            <p> In an earlier point, I mentioned posing. The reason posing is not it’s own point, is because there are in fact very few poses you will do in a headshot session due to the photo being shoulder or chest up. This is why, if you focus on anything during your headshot session, it’s your eyes and the thoughts that are coming through.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="summary-li">
                        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
                        <p>There is a lot of pressure in this industry when it comes to headshots, as they are the first thing to get you into the audition room. I won’t diminish this pressure by telling you it’s not important, because they are. However, I will tell you that headshots very often speak to you and those who see it. So trust that. </p>
                        <p>Picking the right headshot can be a nightmare for some actors. You not only have to look at yourself photo after photo, but you have to narrow it down to 2 or 3. A great way to begin the narrowing down process is making sure your selections check off these points above. </p>
                        <p>If they do, start asking friends and family what their first impressions are within the first 3 seconds of seeing the image - does it check off these points for them too? This is a great way to begin your selection journey. </p>
                        </li>

My hope in creating The Messy Actor is to provide advice, tips, and resources to provide answers for those who seek them. Learning allows growth, and growth allows freedom to play - I believe we are the best artists we can be when we are free to play & get messy. </p>
